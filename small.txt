The term social anarchism is often used to identify [[communitarian]] forms of anarchism that emphasize cooperation and mutual aid. Social anarchism includes anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-communism, libertarian socialism, anarcho-syndicalism, [[social ecology]] and sometimes mutualism.\n\n====Collectivist anarchism====\n{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}\n''Collectivist anarchism'', also referred to as ''revolutionary socialism'' or a form of such<ref>Morris, Brian.

The collectivist ''category'' is also sometimes known as social, socialist, or communitarian anarchism category.</ref> Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or "[[propaganda by the deed]]," which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.<ref name = "Patsouras-p54"/>  However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism.

Anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late 19th century by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and [[gender role]]s.\n\nMany [[anarcha-feminists]] are especially critical of marriage.

The men became international political celebrities among the labor movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labor movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organize for the eight hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.<ref>{{cite book |last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 }}</ref> The celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on [[May Day]] became an annual event the following year.\n\nIn 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], [[Christiaan Cornelissen]], etc. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte in particular opposed themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social [[revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.<ref>[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}</ref> Malatesta thought that trade-unions were [[reformism|reformist]], and could even be, at times, [[Conservatism|conservative]]. Along with Cornelissen, he cited as example [[Labor unions in the United States|US trade-unions]], where trade-unions composed of qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to non-qualified workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position.\n\nThe Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics and played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.<ref>Carley, Mark "Trade union membership 1993–2003" (International:SPIRE Associates 2004)</ref> Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.\n\n=== Russian Revolution===\n{{main|Russian Revolution (1917)}}\n[[Image:Goldmanberkman.jpeg|thumb|right|Anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] opposed [[Bolshevik]] consolidation of power following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)]].]]\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Ukraine]], anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against Whites and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who attempted to establish an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.\n\nExpelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin's]] predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist” Marxist state would become a new elite<ref name="bakuninmarx">"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]" in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971</ref> had proved all too true.\n\nThe victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US, for example, certain members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].\n\nIn Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the ''[[Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]'',<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda group |authorlink=Dielo Trouda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkism.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}</ref> was supported. [[Platformist]] groups active today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland and the [[NEFAC|North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] of North America.\n\n[[Image:Members of the Maquis in La Tresorerie.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-fascist [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], who resisted [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] rule in Europe.]]\n\n===Fight against fascism===\n{{main|Anti-fascism}}{{See also|Anarchism in Italy|Anarchism in France|Anarchism in Spain}}\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and marked up numerous successful victories, including repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.<ref>Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 "Daring but Divided"] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002)</ref> In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.<ref>Berry, David. "Fascism or Revolution." ''Le Libertaire''. August 1936)</ref>\n\nIn Spain, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivized]] the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the [[Soviet Union]]. According to [[George Orwell]] and other foreign observers, Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|dissident Marxists]] and anarchists.\n\n==Internal issues and debates==\n{{main|Issues in anarchism}}\n<!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. -->\nAnarchism is a philosophy which embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]] (which anarchists usually reject, according to the ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]''),<ref name=oxcom/> [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys a complex relationship with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[ethical egoism|enlightened self-interest]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.\n\nPhenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards [[Issues in anarchism#Race|race]], [[Issues in anarchism#Gender|gender]] and [[Issues in anarchism#The environment|the environment]] have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the 18th century.\n\nOn a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[Issues in anarchism#Definitional concerns|definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Anarchism portal}}\n* [[Anarchist symbolism]]\n* [[List of basic anarchism topics]]\n\n==Further reading==\n{{main|List of anarchist books}}\n* ''Anarchism.

Albedo is defined as\nthe ratio of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] to incident [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is a [[Dimensionless number|unitless]] measure indicative of a surface's or body's diffuse [[reflectivity]]. The word is derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' "whiteness", in turn from ''albus'' "white". The range of possible values is from 0 (dark) to 1 (bright).\n[[Image:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|Percentage of diffusely reflected sun light in relation to various surface conditions of the Earth]]\n\nThe albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. In climatology it is sometimes expressed as a percentage. Its value depends on the [[frequency]] of radiation considered: unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the direction and directional distribution of incoming radiation. Exceptions are [[Lambertian]] surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions in a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incoming distribution. In realistic cases, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) is required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although albedos are a very useful first approximation.\n\n==Terrestrial albedo==\n{| class="wikitable" border="1" style="float: right;"\n|+ Sample albedos\n|-\n!

Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[Black body|blackbody]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.<ref name="PhysicsWorld">[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html Albedo - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The average albedo of the [[Earth]] is about 30%.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Goode |first=P.

However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.\n\nThe classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature [[feedback]]. If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.\n\nThe Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments onboard the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance.  \n\n===White-sky and black-sky albedo===\nIt has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar [[Celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] <math>{\\theta_i}</math> can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, <math>{\\bar \\alpha(\\theta_i)}</math>, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, <math>{\\bar \\bar \\alpha}</math> the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination <math>{D}</math>.\n\nAlbedo <math>{\\alpha}</math> can then be given as:\n\n:<math>{\\alpha}= (1-D) \\bar \\alpha(\\theta_i) + D \\bar \\bar \\alpha.</math>\n\n[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.\n\n==Astronomical albedo==\nThe albedo of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellites|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in [[asteroid]]s. \n\n[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 86%.

Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.\n\nIn detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the [[opposition effect]] of [[regolith]] surfaces.\n\nThe correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is:<ref name=bruton>{{cite web\n  |title=Conversion of Absolute Magnitude to Diameter for Minor Planets\n  |publisher=Department of Physics & Astronomy (Stephen F.

It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]), the size of the particle(s), and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.\n\n==Some examples of terrestrial albedo effects==\n\n===The tropics===\nAlthough the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area increases up to 3 °C (5.4 °F) year-round,<ref>Dickinson, R. E., and P. J. Kennedy, 1992: ''Impacts on regional climate of Amazon deforestation''. Geophys. Res. Lett., '''19''', 1947–1950.</ref><ref>[http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2006/final/characterization/abiotic_water.html http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2006/final/characterization/abiotic_water.html]  Project Amazonia: Characterization - Abiotic - Water</ref> although part of the effect is due to changed evaporation ([[latent heat]] flux).\n\n===Small scale effects===\nAlbedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear lighter color clothes.<ref>[http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&s0897.html Health and Safety: Be Cool! (8/97)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Trees===\nBecause trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby could produce localized climate cooling. [[Cloud feedback]]s further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 while [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.<ref name="mmutrees">{{cite web | url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/Resources/gcc/1-3-3.html | title=The Climate System | publisher=Manchester Metropolitan University | accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> The difference between deciduous and coniferous is because coniferous trees are darker in general and have cone-shaped crowns. The shape of these crowns trap radiant energy more effectively than deciduous trees.  \n\nStudies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.<ref>Betts, R.A. (2000) ''Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo'', Nature, Volume 408, Issue 6809, pp. 187-190.</ref>\n\n===Snow===\nSnow albedos can be as high as 90%; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[positive feedback]]). \n\n===Water===\nWater reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).\n[[Image:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 C (refractive index=1.333)]]\nAt the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence|angles of incident]] light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.<ref>[http://vih.freeshell.org/pp/01-ONW-St.Petersburg/Fresnel.pdf]</ref>\n\nAlthough the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. \n\nNote that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up (not smooth at the scale of the wavelength of light) so the Fresnel equations do not apply. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.\n\n===Clouds===\n{{see|Cloud albedo}}\n\nClouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."<ref>[http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth | LiveScience<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAlbedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.<ref>http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf</ref> A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields by [[Saddam Hussein]] showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10<sup>o</sup>C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992JGR....9714565C The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Aerosol effects===\n[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCNs]] and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain.<ref>[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nAerosol radiative forcing.\nAerosols can modify the Earth’s radiative balance through the aerosol direct and indirect\neffects.\n<br />\n''—Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of\nradiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.\n<br />\n''—Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the\naerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Increased CCN concentrations\nlead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC). A greater number of cloud\ndroplets leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (first\nindirect effect). Increased CDNC also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased\nlifetime of the cloud (second indirect effect).\n</blockquote> <ref>DOMINICK V. SPRACKLEN, BORIS BONN, AND KENNETH S.

Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] [[aleph]].\n\nWhen the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]] that the letter had denoted in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], so they used the sign for the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and kept its name with a minor change ([[alpha (letter)|alpha]]). In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.\n\nThe [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to write [[Latin]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern [[Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including [[English language|English]].\n\n{| cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0" style="background-color: white; float: right;"\n|- align="center"\n|[[Image:BlackletterA-01.png|Blackletter A]]<br />[[Blackletter]] A \n|[[Image:UncialA-01.svg|Uncial A]]<br />[[Uncial]] A\n|[[Image:Acap.svg|Another Capital A]]<br />Another Blackletter A&nbsp;\n|- align="center"\n|[[Image:ModernRomanA-01.svg|64 px|Modern Roman A]]<br />Modern Roman A\n|[[Image:Modern Italic A.svg|64 px|Modern Italic A]]<br />Modern Italic A\n|[[Image:Modern Script A.svg|64 px|Modern Script A]]<br />Modern Script A\n|}\nThe letter has two [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current [[handwriting]], and in [[italic type]], consists of a circle and vertical stroke ({{Unicode|ɑ}}), called [[Latin alpha]] or "script a". Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{IPA|a}}). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.\n\n== Usage ==\n[[Image:LowercaseA.svg|right|thumb|200|Typographic variants include a double-story and single-story '''a'''.]]\nIn [[English language|English]], the letter "A" by itself usually denotes the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/æ/}}) as in ''pad'', the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) as in ''father'', or, in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} (though the pronunciation varies with the dialect) as in ''ace'' and ''major'', due to effects of the [[great vowel shift]].\n\nIn most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, the letter A denotes either an [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑ/}}), or an [[open central unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/a/}}).

Settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of fertile soils. Planters brought slaves with them, and traders brought in more from the Upper South as the cotton plantations expanded. The economy of the central "[[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]" featured large cotton plantations whose owners built their wealth on the labor of enslaved African Americans. It was named for the dark, fertile soil.<ref name="SSpaces"/> Elsewhere poor whites were subsistence farmers. According to the 1860 census, enslaved Africans comprised 45% of the state's population of 964,201. There were only 2,690 free persons of color. \n\nIn 1861 Alabama seceded from the Union to join the [[Confederate States of America]]. While not many battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the Civil War. All the slaves were freed by 1865.<ref name="HistDocs">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.historicaldocuments.com/13thAmendment.htm\n| title = 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Abolition of Slavery (1865)\n| accessdate = 2006-09-23\n| year = 2005\n| work = Historical Documents\n| publisher = HistoricalDocuments.com}}</ref> Following [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Alabama was readmitted to the Union in 1868.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the state was still chiefly rural and tied to cotton. Planters resisted working with free labor and sought to re-establish controls over African Americans. Whites used paramilitary groups, [[Jim Crow laws]] and segregation to reduce freedoms of African Americans and restore their own dominance.\n\nIn its new constitution of 1901, the legislature effectively disenfranchised African Americans through voting restrictions. While the planter class had engaged poor whites in supporting these efforts, the new restrictions resulted in disenfranchising poor whites as well. By 1941, a total of more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks. This was due mostly to effects of the cumulative poll tax.<ref name="epzzsd">Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p.136</ref>\n\nThe damage to the African-American community was more pervasive, as nearly all its citizens lost the ability to vote. In 1900, fourteen Black Belt counties (which were primarily African American) had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls. By June 1, 1903, the number of registered voters had dropped to 1,081. In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 had managed to "qualify" to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were literate. The shut out was long-lasting.<ref name="epzzsd"/>  The disenfranchisement was ended only by African Americans leading the Civil Rights Movement and gaining Federal legislation in the mid-1960s to protect their voting and civil rights. Such legislation also protected the rights of poor whites.\n\nThe rural-dominated legislature continued to underfund schools and services for African Americans in the segregated state, but did not relieve them of paying taxes.<ref name="SSpaces">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.southernspaces.org/contents/2004/tullos/4a.htm\n| title = The Black Belt\n| accessdate = 2006-09-23\n| date = 2004-04-19\n| work = Southern Spaces Internet Journal\n| publisher = Emory University}}</ref> Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek out opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration]] to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities. The rate of population growth rate in Alabama (see table) dropped by nearly half from 1910–1920, reflecting the outmigration. \n\nAt the same time, many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of Birmingham for work in new industrial jobs. It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed "The Magic City." By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30% of the population of the state. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy.\n\nDespite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside of Birmingham.\n\nOne result was that Jefferson County, home of Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."<ref name="pjhwpa"/>\n\nBecause of the long disfranchisement of African Americans, the state continued as one-party Democratic for decades. It produced a number of national leaders. Industrial development related to the demands of [[World War II]] brought prosperity.<ref name="SSpaces"/> Cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. In the 1960s under Governor [[George Wallace]], many whites in the state opposed integration efforts.\n\nDuring the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a restoration of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964,<ref name="cra64">[http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 Civil Rights Act of 1964]</ref> and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population was implemented. This benefited the many urban areas that had developed, and all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60&nbsp;years.<ref name="pjhwpa"/>\n\nAfter 1972, the state's white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections (as also occurred in neighboring southern states).

Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300&nbsp;days in the southern part of the state.<ref name="cprgsw"/> \n\nSummers in Alabama are among the hottest in the United States, with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken. \n\n[[Image:Alabama winter 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Though winters in the state are usually mild, nightly freezing occurs frequently in the [[North Alabama]] region. This is shown in this picture taken at the [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]] in [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]] during early January.]]\n\nSouth Alabama reports more [[thunderstorms]] than any part of the U.S. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80&nbsp;days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&nbsp;days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]] – the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.<ref>Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 1990–2003, [http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_lls/fatalities_us.html ]  Retrieved May 8, 2007 </ref> Sometimes [[tornado]]es occur – these are common throughout the state, although the peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama shares the dubious distinction, with [[Kansas]], of having reported more [[Fujita scale|F5 tornadoes]] than any other state – according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950 to October 31, 2006. An F5 tornado is the most powerful of its kind.<ref>Tornadoproject.com, [http://www.tornadoproject.com/fscale/fscale.htm Fujita scale]. Retrieved September 3, 2007 </ref> Several long – tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state except for [[Texas]] and [[Mississippi]]. The [[Super Outbreak]] of March, 1974, badly affected Alabama. The northern part of the state – along the Tennessee Valley – is one of the areas in the US most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season (November and December) in addition to the Spring severe weather season.\n\nWinters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the [[southeastern United States]], with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Snow is a rare event in much of Alabama. Areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.\n\n{| class="wikitable" border="1" style="text-align:center;font-size:100%;"\n| colspan = "26" style="font-size:120%;background:#e8eafa;"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Alabama cities<small><ref>[http://www.ustravelweather.com/weather-alabama/ US Travel Weather]{{dead link|date=December 2008}}</ref></small>\n|-\n!

Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|US Army Aviation and Missile Command]], headquartered at [[Redstone Arsenal]].\n\nAlabama is also home to the largest industrial growth corridor in the nation, including the surrounding states of Tennessee, Mississippi, Florida, and Georgia. Most of this growth is due to Alabama's rapidly expanding automotive manufacturing industry. In Alabama alone since 1993, it has generated more than 67,800 new jobs. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation in [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2008_fotw539.html automobile output]. \n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Birmingham's economy was transformed by investments in bio-technology and medical research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and its adjacent hospital. The UAB Hospital is a Level I trauma center providing health care and breakthrough medical research. UAB is now the area's largest employer and the largest in Alabama with a workforce of about 20,000. Health care services provider HealthSouth is also headquartered in the city.\n\nBirmingham is also a leading banking center, serving as home to two major banks: Regions Financial Corporation and Compass Bancshares. SouthTrust, another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by Wachovia in 2004. The city still has major operations as one of the regional headquarters of Wachovia. In November 2006, Regions Financial merged with AmSouth Bancorporation, which was also headquartered in Birmingham. They formed the 8th Largest U. S. Bank (by total assets). Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the Magic City, such as Superior Bank and New South Federal Savings Bank.\n\nTelecommunications provider AT&T, formerly BellSouth, has a major presence with several large offices in the metropolitan area. Major insurance providers: Protective Life, Infinity Property & Casualty and ProAssurance among others, are headquartered in Birmingham and employ a large number of people in Greater Birmingham. The city is also a powerhouse of construction and engineering companies, including BE&K and B. L. Harbert International which routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design and international construction firms.\n\nHuntsville is regarded for its high-technology driven economy and is known as the "Rocket City" due to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Redstone Arsenal. Huntsville's main economic influence is derived from aerospace and military technology. Redstone Arsenal, Cummings Research Park (CRP), The University of Alabama in Huntsville and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center comprise the main hubs for the area's technology-driven economy. CRP is the second largest research park in the United States and the fourth largest in the world, and is over 38 years old. Huntsville is also home for commercial technology companies such as the network access company ADTRAN, computer graphics company Intergraph and design and manufacturer of IT infrastructure Avocent. Telecommunications provider Deltacom, Inc. and copper tube manufacturer and distributor Wolverine Tube are also based in Huntsville. Cinram manufactures and distributes 20th Century Fox DVDs and Blu-ray Discs out of their Huntsville plant. Sanmina-SCI also has a large presence in the area. Forty-two Fortune 500 companies have operations in Huntsville.  In 2005, Forbes Magazine named the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area as 6th best place in the nation for doing business, and number one in terms of the number of engineers per total employment.\n\nThe city of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a busy seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] via the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].

For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 9% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 5%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 14% tax on a meal. Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51 percent of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36 percent nationwide. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the nation's very highest. Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line. Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.\n\nThe corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf |title=Alabama State Local Tax Burden Compared to U.S. Average (1970–2007) |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |work=Tax Foundation }}</ref>  Property taxes are the lowest in the United States.

One of its amendments lowered the percentage of fair-market value at which property was taxed and another declared that timber and farmland would be taxed on the value of its current use instead of what the land is worth.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}\n\nSince Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&nbsp;million. It is one of only a few handful of states to accomplish large surpluses, with a budget surplus of nearly $1.2&nbsp;billion in 2007, and estimated at more than $2.1&nbsp;billion for 2008. However, the declining national economy in 2008 has eliminated that surplus and the state is again facing shortfall, with the governor declaring "proration," which will result in an immeditate education budget cut and school layoffs.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Alabama.JPG|thumb|right|Alabama state welcome sign]]\n\nAlabama has five major interstate roads that cross it: [[I-65]] runs north–south roughly through the middle of the state; I-59/I-20 travels from the central west border to Birmingham, where [[I-59]] continues to the north-east corner of the state and [[I-20]] continues east towards Atlanta; [[I-85]] originates in Montgomery and runs east-northeast to the Georgia border, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, running from west to east through Mobile. Another interstate road, [[I-22]], is currently under construction. When completed around 2012 it will connect Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  Several US Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11|US 11]], [[U.S. Route 29|US 29]], [[U.S. Route 31|US 31]], [[U.S. Route 43|US 43]], [[U.S. Route 72|US 72]], [[U.S. Route 78|US 78]], [[U.S. Route 80|US 80]], [[U.S. Route 82|US 82]], [[U.S. Route 84|US 84]], [[U.S. Route 98|US 98]], [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]], and [[U.S. Route 280|US 280]].\n\nMajor airports in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals – Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] (MSL), [[Tuscaloosa Regional Airport]] (TCL), and [[Pryor Field Regional Airport]] (DCU).

Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.\n\nAlabama is divided into three equal branches:\nThe [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. \n\nThe [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[Governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[Alabama State Auditor]].\n\nThe [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]].\n\n===Local and county government===\nAlabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Due to the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.\n*[[List of Alabama county seats]]\n\nAlabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. However, counties can declare themselves "dry"; the state does not sell alcohol in those areas.\n\n===State politics===\n[[Image:Bob Riley greeting soldiers in Birmingham, 19 Jan, 2004.jpg|thumb|Alabama Governor Bob Riley in 2004]]\n\nThe current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]]. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] is [[Jim Folsom Jr]]. The [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] currently holds a large majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. Due to the Legislature's power to override a gubernatorial [[veto]] by a mere simple majority (most state Legislatures require a 2/3 majority to override a veto), the relationship between the executive and legislative branches can be easily strained when different parties control the branches.\n\nDuring [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of whites passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise black residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites, however. By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised.\n\nFrom 1901 to the 1960s, the state legislature failed to perform redistricting as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972. \n\nWith the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the "[[Solid South]]", a one-party system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. \n\nIn the 1986 Democratic primary election, the then-incumbent Lieutenant Governor lost the Democratic nomination for Governor. The state Democratic party invalidated the election and placed the Lieutenant Governor's name on the ballot as the Democratic candidate instead of the candidate chosen in the primary. The voters of the state revolted at what they perceived as disenfranchisement of their right to vote and elected the Republican challenger [[Guy Hunt]] as Governor. This was the first Republican Governor elected in Alabama since Reconstruction. Since then, Republicans have been increasingly elected to state offices until in 2006 Democrats were barely holding a majority in the state legislature. Since 1986, only one Democrat, [[Don Siegelman]], has managed to win the Governor's office. A corruption probe and eventual trial, the timing of which coincided with the 2006 state primary, relegated Siegelman to one term. \n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], when majority whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. [[George Wallace]], the state's governor, remains a notorious and controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964<ref name="cra64"/> and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage and other civil rights.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and the Governor signed, a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date-2007-06-01 |accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref>\n\n{{further|[[Political party strength in Alabama]]}}\n\n===National politics===\n{|  border="2" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="float:right; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:85%;"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''\n|- style="background:LightGrey;"\n!

The Democrats won with [[John F. Kennedy]] on the ballot, but the Democratic electors from Alabama gave 6 of their 11 electoral votes as a protest to [[Harry F. Byrd|Harry Byrd]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] carried the state, in part because of his opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which restored the franchise for African Americans.\n\nIn [[United States presidential election, 1968|the 1968 presidential election]], Alabama supported native son and [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]] over both [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], Democratic candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.\n\nSince 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and comprise a longstanding majority in the [[Alabama Legislature]]; see [[Dixiecrat]].\n\nIn [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], [[George W. Bush]] won Alabama's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote, mostly white voters. The eleven counties that voted Democratic were [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] counties, where [[African American]]s are the majority racial group. \n\nThe state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C.

These legends state that Achilles was killed in battle by an arrow to the heel, and so an "[[Achilles' heel]]" has come to mean a person's principal weakness. \n\n==Birth==\nAchilles was the son of the [[nymph]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]], the fire-bringer, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed  Peleus.<ref>[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755-768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34-37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26-47; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' (ii.15)</ref>\n \nAs with most mythology there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in ''[[Argonautica]]'' (iv.760) [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis's chaste resistance to the advances of [[Zeus]], that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him.<!--the following psychological interpretation has no counterpart in the myths:"Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. So Hera recommended that she marry [[Peleus]], as he was as near to a mortal as she was ever going to get."-->\n\n[[Image:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'' (ca. 1772), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]]]]\nAccording to a fragment of an ''Achilleis''— the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by [[Statius]] in the first century AD, and to no other sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body she held him by, his heel. (See [[Achilles heel]], [[Achilles' tendon]].) It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.<ref>[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869-479.</ref> \n\nHowever none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability.  To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood."\n\nAlso in the fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] in which we can find description of the hero's death, [[Cypria|Kùpria]] (unknown author), ''[[Aithiopis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], ''[[Little Iliad|Ilias Mikrà]]'' by Lesche of Mytilene, Iliou pèrsis by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase-paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body. \n\nPeleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on Mt. [[Pelion]], to be raised.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87-89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830-32</ref>\n\n==Achilles in the Trojan War==\n[[Image:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]]]\n\nThe first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:\n:{{Polytonic|μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος}}\n:{{Polytonic|οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν,}}\n\n:Sing, Goddess, of the rage, of Peleus' son Achilles\n:the accursed rage, which brought pain to thousands of the Achaeans.\n\nAchilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage (''menis''). His anger is at some times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative. \n\n===Telephus===\nWhen the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that "he that wounded shall heal". Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos]], where Achilles heals him in order that he become their guide for the voyage to Troy. \n\t\t\nAccording to other reports in [[Euripides]]' lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed\n\n===Cycnus of Colonae===\nAccording to the [[Cypria]] <ref name="stoa.org">[http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 Proclus' Summary of the Cypria]</ref> of the [[Epic Cycle]] and traditions related by [[Plutarch]] and the Byzantine scholar [[John Tzetzes]], once the Greek ships arrived in Troy, Achilles fought and killed [[Cycnus|Cycnus of Colonae]], a son of Poseidon.\n\n===Troilus===\nAccording to the [[Cypria]] (the part of the [[Epic Cycle]] that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighboring cities and killed [[Troilus]].<ref name="stoa.org"/>\n\nAccording to [[Dares Phrygius]]' ''Account of the Destruction of Troy'',<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/DaresTW.html Dares' account of the destruction of Troy, Greek Mythology Link.<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, [[Troilus]] was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King [[Priam]]'s (or sometimes [[Apollo]]) and [[Hecuba]]'s five legitimate sons. Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed and decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo by Achilles.  In this version of the myth, Achilles' death came in retribution for a sacrilege he had previously committed, his decapitation of [[Troilus]] upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo.<ref>James Davidson, "Zeus Be Nice Now" in ''London Review of Books;'' 19 July 2007[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html] accessed October 23rd, 2007</ref> Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the [[First Vatican Mythographer]] claimed Troy would have been invincible.\n\n===In the ''Iliad''===\n[[Image:AmbrosianIliadPict47Achilles.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Achilles sacrificing to [[Zeus]], from the [[Ambrosian Iliad]], a 5th century illuminated manuscript.]]\n{{main|Iliad}}\n\n[[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the [[Trojan War]]. The Heroic epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begged Agamemnon to return her to him.  Agamemnon refused and Apollo sent a plague amongst the Greeks.  The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless Achilles vowed to protect him. Achilles did so and Calchas declared Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consented, but then commanded that Achilles' battle prize [[Briseis]] be brought to replace Chryseis.  Angry at the dishonor (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis)<ref>''Iliad'' 9.334-343.</ref> and at the urging of Thetis, Achilles refused to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces.\n\nAs the battle turned against the Greeks, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declared that the Trojans were winning because Agamemnon had angered Achilles, and urged the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agreed and sent [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles refused and urged the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.\n\nEventually, however, hoping to retain glory despite his absence from the battle, Achilles prayed to his mother Thetis, asking her to plead with Zeus to allow the Trojans to push back the Greek forces.\n \nThe Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, Patroclus led the [[Myrmidons]] into battle, though Achilles remained at his camp. Patroclus succeeded in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but was killed by Hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.\n\n=== Achilles' revenge on Hector ===\n[[Image:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|250px|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in front of the Gates of [[Troy]]. (From a [[panoramic]] [[fresco]] on the upper level of the main hall of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion)]]]]\nAfter receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieved over his close friend's death and held many funeral games in his honor.  His mother Thetis came to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuaded [[Hephaestus]] to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by [[Hector]]. The new armor included the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail by the poet.\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Triumphant Achilles in Achilleion cc.jpg|thumb|250px|This is a color-corrected version of the original image above.]] -->\nEnraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector.  Achilles even engaged in battle with the river god [[Scamander]] who became angry that Achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed.  The god tried to drown Achilles but was stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus.  Zeus himself took note of Achilles' rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack Troy itself, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles could defy fate itself as Troy was not meant to be destroyed yet.  Finally Achilles found his prey. Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuaded Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realized the trick, he knew his death was inevitable and accepted his fate. Hector, wanting to go down fighting, charged at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword.  Achilles got his vengeance, killing Hector with a single blow to the neck.  He then tied Hector's body to his [[chariot]] and dragged it around the battlefield for nine days.\n\nWith the assistance of the god [[Hermes]], Hector's father, [[Priam]], went to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles to permit him to perform for Hector his funeral rites.  The final passage in the ''Iliad'' is Hector's funeral, after which the doom of Troy was just a matter of time.\n\n====Penthesilea====\nAchilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] warrior queen [[Penthesilea]], but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, due to Penthesilia's superior fighting skills, he refocused, and killed her. As he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty, a notorius Greek jeerer by the name of Thersites laughed and mocked the great Achilles. Annoyed by his insensitivity and disrespect, Achilles punched him in the face and killed him instantly.\n\n====Memnon, and the fall of the Achilles====\n[[Image:Achilles thniskon in Corfu.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Achilles dying in the gardens of the [[Corfu#Beauty, Power and Tragedy: The Achilleion|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]]]\n\nFollowing the death of Patroclus, Achilles's closest companion was Nestor's son [[Antilochus]].  When [[Memnon]], king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]] killed Antilochus, Achilles was once again drawn onto the battlefield to seek revenge. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.\n\nMany Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad'''s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles's reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century B.C. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors. \n\nAs predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, Achilles was thereafter killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to [[Statius]]). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris's arrow.\n[[Image:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles: [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure ''[[lekythos]]'', ca. 510 BCE, from Sicily ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich]] Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented  in the lost Trojan War epic of [[Arctinus of Miletus]] as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]] (see below).  Another version of Achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, Polyxena, Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage.  Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alligance with the world's greatest warrior.  But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow killing him.\n\nParis was later killed by [[Philoctetes]] using the enormous bow of [[Heracles]].\n\n====The fate of Achilles's armor====\nAchilles's armor was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax (mythology)|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus. Odysseus won. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena.  Athena temporarily made Ajax mad with grief and anguish as he began killing sheep, thinking they were his comrades.  After a while, Athena had lifted the madness and Ajax had seen that he had actually been killing sheep.  In his embarrassment, he then committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles.\n\nA relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his courtbiographers do not mention the spear, which he would indeed have touched with excitement.<ref>"Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear." (Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great''1973.144.</ref> But it was being shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the second century CE.<ref>Pausanias,  iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, "The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece", ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing (1980:65-85) esp. p. 81. </ref>\n\n==Achilles and Patroclus==\n{{main|Achilles and Patroclus}}\nAchilles's relationship with Patroclus is a key aspect of his myth.  Its exact nature has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times.  In the ''[[Iliad]]'', they appeared to be generally portrayed as a model of deep and loyal friendship.  However, commentators from the classical period to today have tended to interpret the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. Thus, in 5th century BC Athens the relationship was commonly interpreted as [[pederastic]]. Contemporary readers are more likely to interpret the two heroes either as non-sexual "war buddies", or as an egalitarian [[homosexual]] couple.\n\n==The cult of Achilles in antiquity==\nThere was an archaic [[heroic cult]] of Achilles on the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|White Island, ''Leuce'']], in the [[Black Sea]] off the modern coasts of [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]], with a temple and an [[oracle]] which survived into the Roman period.<ref>Guy Hedreen, "The Cult of Achilles in the Euxine" ''Hesperia'' '''60'''.3 (July 1991), pp. 313-330.</ref>\n\nIn the lost epic ''[[Aithiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''[[Iliad]]'' attributed to [[Arctinus|Arktinus of Miletos]],  Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn  him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games.\n\n[[Pliny's Natural History]] (IV.27.1) mentions a [[tumulus]] that is no longer evident (''Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara''), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from [[Peuce]] by the [[Danube Delta]], and the temple there. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue” (III.19.11). Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.\n\n[[Pomponius Mela]] tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister (''De situ orbis'', II, 7). And the Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called ''Leuce'' "because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor” (''Orbis descriptio'', v. 541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913).\n\nThe ''[[Periplus|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' gives the following details: "It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships”. (quoted in Densuşianu)\n\nThe heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the [[Black Sea|Pontic Sea]] but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.\n\nAchilles from Leuce island was venerated as ''Pontarches'' the lord and master of the Pontic (Black) Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce  were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia ([[Stephanus Byzantinus]]), Achilleios in Laconia ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], III.25,4) [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] (Densuşianu 1913) even thought he recognized Achilles in the name of [[Aquileia]] and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia ("Achileii"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law."\n\nLeuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the [[Delphi|Delphic Pythia]] sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound.  [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.\n\n===The cult of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu===\nIn the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of [[Corfu]] [[Greece]], Empress of Austria [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]] also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to [[platonic]] [[romanticism]]. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: ''[[Corfu#Beauty, Power and Tragedy: The Achilleion|Achilleion]]'' (Αχίλλειον). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the [[Trojan war]].\n\n==The name of Achilles==\nAchilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{Polytonic|ἄχος}} (''akhos'') "grief" and {{Polytonic|λαός}} (''Laos'') "a people, tribe, nation, etc." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of ''kleos'' (glory, usually glory in war).\n\n''Laos'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following Leonard Palmer, to mean ''a corps of soldiers''. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.\n\nThe name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks early after 7th century BC.<ref>[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search_main.html Epigraphical database] gives 164 matches for Ἀχιλλεύς and 368 for Ἀχιλλε.The earliest ones: Corinth 7th c. BC,Delphi 530 BC,Attica and Elis 5th c. BC.</ref> It was also turned into the female form of Ἀχιλλεία,firstly attested in Attica,4th century BC, (IG II² 1617) and [[Female gladiator#Halicarnassus|Achillia]], [[:Image:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|a relief from Halicarnassus]] as the name of a female gladiator fighting, 'Amazonia'.  Roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology and this seems to reference Achilles' fight with Penthesilea, but give it an extra twist of Achilles being 'played' by a woman.\n\n==Other stories about Achilles==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\n[[Image:Achilles in Corfu.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]. He gazes northward toward the city. The inscription in Greek reads: ΑΧΙΛΛΕΥΣ i.e. Achilles]] \nSome post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]].  There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl).  With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], whom in the account of [[Statius]] he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias).  According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid.  Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods.  When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign.  In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.\n\nIn book 11 of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]],'' Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.  This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the [[Greek colonies]] on the [[Black Sea]], the location of the mythical "White Island" which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.\n\nThe kings of the [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epiran princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor; he is said to have visited his tomb while passing Troy.\n\nAchilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (mythology)|Helene]]. Some also said he married [[Medea]], and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades — as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius' [[Argonautica]]. In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive [[Briseis]].\n\n==Achilles in Greek tragedy==\n{{main|Achilles (play)}}\nThe [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the [[Trojan War]], including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play.  The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.<ref>Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002</ref>\n\nThe tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote a play with Achilles as the main character, ''The Lovers of Achilles''. Only a few fragments survive.\n\n==Achilles in Greek philosophy==\nThe philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centered one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between "swift-footed" [[Zeno's paradoxes#Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], in which he proved that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible.

He successfully led the country through its greatest internal crisis, the [[American Civil War]], preserving the Union and ending slavery. As the war was drawing to a close, Lincoln became the first American president to be [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassinated]]. Before his election in 1860 as the first [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] president, Lincoln had been a [[lawyer]], an [[Illinois]] [[Illinois House of Representatives|state legislator]], a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], and twice an unsuccessful candidate for election to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].\n\nAs an outspoken opponent of the expansion of [[slavery in the United States]],<ref>{{harvnb|Goodwin|2005|p= 91}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Holzer|2004|p=232}}</ref> Lincoln won the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination in 1860 and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president]] later that year. His tenure in office was occupied primarily with the defeat of the [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] [[Confederate States of America]] in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of [[slavery]], issuing his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863 and promoting the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln's death and was ratified by the states later in 1865.\n\nLincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort, especially the selection of top [[Military rank|generals]], including [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the Republican Party well, bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate. Lincoln successfully defused the [[Trent Affair]], a war scare with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1861. Under his leadership, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] took control of the [[Border states (Civil War)|border slave states]] at the start of the war. Additionally, he managed his own reelection in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].\n\nOpponents of the war (also known as [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]) criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republicans]], an abolitionist faction of the Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. Even with these road blocks, Lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches; his [[Gettysburg Address]] is but one example of this. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation. His successor in the White House, Andrew Johnson, also wanted reconciliation among white Americans, but failed to protect the rights of newly freed slaves. [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln's assassination in 1865]] was the first presidential assassination in [[U.S. history]]. He has since consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|greatest U.S. Presidents]].<ref name=Scholar_surveys>Note especially Lincoln's ranking in the [[Historical_rankings_of_United_States_Presidents#Scholar_survey_results|Scholar survey results]] section.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Childhood and education===\n[[Image:HinghamSign.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Samuel Lincoln, first American ancestor of Abraham, worshipped at Old Ship Church, Hingham, Massachusetts]]\nAbraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Hanks]], two uneducated farmers, in a one-room [[log cabin]] on the {{convert|348|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} Sinking Spring Farm, in southeast [[Hardin County, Kentucky]] (now part of [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue County]]), making him the first president born outside the original [[thirteen colonies]]. Lincoln's ancestor [[Samuel Lincoln]]<ref>In 1848 attorney and historian Solomon Lincoln of [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], began a correspondence with Abraham Lincoln to determine whether the future President's ancestors originated in Massachusetts. Fortunately, Solomon Lincoln saved his correspondence with distant relation Abraham, which the Hingham lawyer published in 1865 in his book ''Notes on the Lincoln Families of Massachusetts with Some Account of the Family of Abraham Lincoln, Late President of the United States''.

He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December 1808 for $200 cash (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|200|1808}}}} today){{inflation-fn|US}} and assumption of a debt. The family belonged to a [[Hard-shell Baptists|Hardshell Baptist]] church, although Abraham himself never joined their church, or any other church for that matter.\n\nIn 1816 the Lincoln family became impoverished, losing their land through court action, and was forced to make a new start in [[Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]], Indiana.<ref>It is now in [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]]), Indiana.</ref> Lincoln later noted that this move was "partly on account of slavery," and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky.<ref> Unlike land in the [[Northwest Territory]], Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property in lawsuits such as the one Thomas Lincoln lost.</ref>\n\nWhen Lincoln was nine, his mother, then 34 years old, died of [[milk sickness]]. Soon afterwards, his father remarried to [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]]. Lincoln and his stepmother were close; he called her "Mother" for the rest of his life, but he was increasingly distant from his father.<ref>{{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp= 28, 152}}</ref>\n\nIn 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/sites/decaturock.htm|title=Lincoln Trail Homestead State Park|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online}}</ref> in [[Macon County, Illinois]]. The following winter was desolate and especially brutal, and the family considered moving back to Indiana. The following year, when his father relocated the family to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the [[Sangamon River]] to the village of [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fehrenbacher|first=Don|title=Speeches and Writings 1859-1865|publisher=Library of America|year=1989|page=163|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UWJStTs8-A4C&dq=lincoln+canoe+sangamon+river&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0}}</ref> Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] via flatboat on the Sangamon, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers.\n\nLincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling, but he was largely self-educated and an avid reader. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an axe.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.lincolnportrait.com/physical_man.asp|title=Abraham Lincoln, The Physical Man |publisher=Lincoln Portrait}}</ref> Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food.<ref>{{harvnb|Sandburg|1974|p=10}}</ref> At 6&nbsp;foot 4&nbsp;inches (1.93&nbsp;m), he was unusually tall, as well as strong.\n\nLincoln's father, Thomas Lincoln, was uneducated and illiterate; however, he was extremely talented in the art of storytelling and entertaining friends. Thomas would regularly host friendly gatherings at his house, which would usually consist of Thomas telling stories all night causing a hilarious uproar from his audience. Stealthily, young Abraham would stay up and listen to his father telling stories, trying to memorize them himself. Occasionally, when Abraham could not understand a certain story or part of one, he would repeat it over and over again in his mind until he finally understood. He then would spend countless hours coming up with a way to put the stories into terms his friends could easily understand. The next day, Abraham would repeat these stories to his friends, mimicking his father. This early practice helped prepare Abraham for the many important speeches he would have to give late in his life.<ref>Goodwin, Doris Kearns. ''Team of Rivals''. New York, NY. Simon & Schuster, Inc. 2005</ref>\n\n===Marriage and family===\n{{further|[[Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln]]}}\nOn November 4, 1842 Lincoln married [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], daughter of a prominent slave-owning family from Kentucky. The couple had four sons. [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in [[Springfield, Illinois]] on August 1, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard College]].\n\nThe other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] was born on March 10, 1846, and died on February 1, 1850, also in Springfield. [[William Wallace Lincoln|William "Willie" Wallace Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862 in [[Washington, D.C.]], during President Lincoln's first term. [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas "Tad" Lincoln]] was born on April 4, 1853, and died on July 16, 1871 in Chicago.\n\nLincoln was not lucky when it came to women. Having lost his first love, Ann Rutledge, to what could possibly have been typhoid fever, he courted Mary Owens, the sister of his friend Elizabeth Abell, with the promise of marriage. Lincoln finally proposed to Owens in May 1837, but the proposal was less than appealing to her. Eighteen months after that rejection, however, Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd. Finally in November 1842, after an eighteen month break in their engagement, they were married in the parlor of the Edwards' mansion. Eventually after their marriage, they settled into a quaint house on Eighth and Jackson in Springfield, which was conveniently located within walking distance of his law office. Mary had a hard time adjusting to her new life because she was used to having slaves perform most of the chores all of her life. Also, because Mary was used to having money her entire life, she struggled with the adjustment to relative poverty. Even though Abraham and Mary struggled with the first couple of years of their marriage, the births of two sons within the first forty months of their marriage helped relieve some of that tension. The Lincolns did not believe in rules and boundaries when it came to their children. They were free and able to do anything they pleased. <ref>Goodwin, Doris Kearns. ''Team of Rivals''. New York, NY. Simon & Schuster, Inc. 2005</ref>\n\n==Early political career and military service==\n\n{{Main|Abraham Lincoln's early life and career}}\n[[Image:Abe Lincoln young.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sketch of a younger Abraham Lincoln]]\nLincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]] as a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the [[Beardstown and Sangamon Canal|Sangamon River]]. Later that year he served as a captain in a company of the Illinois militia during the Black Hawk War, although he never saw combat.\n\nIn 1834, he won an election to the state legislature and, after coming across the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', began to teach himself law. [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted to the bar]] in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois that same year and began to practice law with [[John T. Stuart]]. With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frank|first=John|title=Lincoln as a Lawyer|publisher=Americana House|year=1991|isbn=0962529028}}</ref> In 1841 Lincoln entered the law practice with [[William Herndon]], a fellow Whig.\n\nHe served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party. In 1837 he made [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery|his first protest against slavery]] in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was "founded on both injustice and bad policy."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=lincoln;cc=lincoln;type=simple;rgn=div1;q1=founded%20on%20both%20injustice%20and%20bad%20policy;view=text;subview=detail;sort=occur;idno=lincoln1;node=lincoln1%3A101|title=Protest in Illinois Legislature on Slavery|publisher=[[University of Michigan Library]]|date=1937-03-03}}</ref> \n\n===Illinois politics===\n[[Image:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|Lincoln in 1846 or 1847]]\nIn 1846 Lincoln was elected to one term in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. A staunch Whig, Lincoln often referred to party leader [[Henry Clay]] as his political idol. As a freshman House member, Lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in Congress. He used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the [[Mexican-American War|war]] with Mexico, which he attributed to [[James Knox Polk|President Polk]]'s desire for "military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood."\n\nLincoln was a key early supporter of [[Zachary Taylor]]'s candidacy for the [[U.S. presidential election, 1848|1848 Whig Presidential nomination]]. When Lincoln's term ended, the incoming Taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote [[Oregon Territory]]. Acceptance would end his career in the fast-growing state of Illinois, so he declined. Returning instead to Springfield, Illinois he turned most of his energies to making a living at the [[bar (law)|bar]], which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county.\n\nIt was during this stage of his life, however, that Lincoln gave one of the most pivotal speeches[http://www.lincolnatpeoria.com/] of his life - speaking not as a politician, but as a private citizen.  Opposed to the 1854 [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], Lincoln spoke to a crowd in Peoria, Illinois, on October 16, 1854, outlining the moral, political and economic arguments against slavery[http://www.mrlincolnandfreedom.org/inside.asp?ID=11&subjectID=2] that he would continue to uphold throughout his career.  This speech marked his re-entry into public life.\n\n===Prairie lawyer===\nBy the mid-1850s, Lincoln faced competing transportation interests — both the river [[barge]]s and the [[railroad]]s. In 1849, he received a patent for a method of lessening the draft of a river craft by pushing horizontal floats into the water alongside the hull.<ref name="NMAH">{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&objkey=19|title=Abraham Lincoln's Patent Model: Improvement for Buoying Vessels Over Shoals|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref> Lincoln represented the [[Alton Railroad|Alton & Sangamon Railroad]] in an 1851 dispute with one of its shareholders, [[James A. Barret]]. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to that corporation on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer proposed Alton & Sangamon route was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue Mr. Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States.\n\nLincoln's most notable criminal trial came in 1858 when he defended [[William "Duff" Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of [[James Preston Metzker]]. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of [[judicial notice]], a rare tactic at that time, to show an eyewitness had lied on the stand. After the witness testified to having seen the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a [[Farmer's Almanac]] to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination to see anything clearly. Based upon this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.\n\n==Republican politics 1854&ndash;1860==\nLincoln returned to politics in response to the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] (1854), which expressly repealed the limits on slavery's extent as determined by the [[Missouri Compromise]] (1820). Illinois Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]], the most powerful man in the Senate, proposed [[popular sovereignty]] as the solution to the slavery impasse, and incorporated it into the Kansas&ndash;Nebraska Act. Douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory, rather than have such a decision imposed on them by Congress.<ref>{{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=&sect;7}}</ref>\n\nIn the October 16, 1854, "[[Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]",<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.mrlincolnandfreedom.org/inside.asp?ID=11&subjectID=2|title=Speech at Peoria, October 16,|publisher=Abraham Lincoln and Freedom}}</ref> Lincoln first stood out among the other [[Free Soil Party|free soil]] orators of the day:<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.lincolnatpeoria.com/|title=Lincoln at Peoria|publisher=Abraham Lincoln at Peoria}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|[The Act has a] ''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate it.

In a stirring campaign, the Republicans carried Illinois in 1854 and elected a senator. Lincoln was the obvious choice, but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex-Democrat [[Lyman Trumbull]]. At the Republican convention in 1856, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for Vice-President.\n\nIn 1857-58, Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]]. Accepting the Republican nomination for Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|his famous speech]]: "'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided.

Lincoln warned that "[[The Slave Power]]" was threatening the values of [[republicanism]], while Douglas emphasized the supremacy of [[democracy]], as set forth in his [[Freeport Doctrine]], which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not. Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature reelected Douglas to the Senate. Nevertheless, Lincoln's speeches on the issue transformed him into a national political star.  New York party leaders invited him to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]] in February 1860 to an elite audience that was startled by the poorly dressed, ugly man from the West. He stunned the audience with the most brilliant political speech they had ever heard. Lincoln was emerging as the intellectual leader of the Republican party, and its best speaker.<ref>Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, "No man ever before made such an impression" on a New York audience; Richard Carwardine, ''Lincoln'' (2003), p. 98; Harold Holzer, ''Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President'' (2006)</ref>\n\n==1860 Presidential election==\n[[Image:The Rail Candidate.jpg|thumb|"The Rail Candidate" - Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is held up by the slavery issue (slave on left) and party organization (''[[New York Tribune]]'' editor [[Horace Greeley]] on right).]]\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1860}}\nLincoln was chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons. His expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals [[William H. Seward]] and [[Salmon P. Chase]]. His "Western" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.<ref>{{cite book|title=Why the Civil War Came|author=Boritt, Gabor S.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=1997-05-29|isbn=0195113764|pages=3–30}}</ref>{{Request quotation|again, one person's opinion is presented as fact. Text seems to ignore the difference between prediction for the future & hope for the future |date=June 2008}} On May 9-10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]. At this convention, Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg|300px|right|thumb|1860 presidential election results]]Lincoln did not campaign on the road. Despite this, he had gained the majority of the popular vote due to the work of the local Republican Party offices throughout the north. They produced tons of campaign posters and leaflets, and thousands of newspaper editorials. There thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making an emphasis on his childhood poverty. The goal was to emphasize the superior power of "free labor," whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. In the South, Lincoln did not appear on a majority of the ballots come the time of the election.\n\nOn November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, [[John C. Breckinridge]] of the Southern Democrats, and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in all of the Southern states. There were [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]] in some states, but even if his opponents had combined in every state, Lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election. Lincoln was the first U. S. President elected from Illinois.\n\n==Presidency and the Civil War==\n{{main|Origins of the American Civil War|Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War}}\nWith the emergence of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West{{ndash}} the focal point of sectional tensions{{ndash}} was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But they suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.\n\n===Secession winter 1860&ndash;1861===\n{{main|Baltimore Plot|Cornerstone Speech}}\nAs Lincoln's election became more likely, secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the Union. On December 20, 1860, [[South Carolina]] took the lead. By February 1, 1861, South Carolina was followed by six other cotton-growing states in the deep South. The seven states soon declared themselves to be a new nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]. The upper South ([[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.\n\nAttempts at compromise, such as the [[Crittenden Compromise]] which would have extended the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri line of 1820]], were discussed. Despite support for the Crittenden Compromise among some Republicans, Lincoln denounced it in private letters, saying "either the Missouri line extended, or... Pop. Sov. would lose us everything we gained in the election; that filibustering for all South of us, and making slave states of it, would follow in spite of us, under either plan",<ref>\n{{cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=UWJStTs8-A4C&pg=PA192&lpg=PA192&dq=%22filibustering+for+all+South+of+us%22&source=web&ots=FmbtJEx71W&sig=4mjHc3bUtD0MltNN1Jt4ffCjvlk&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result\n|title=Speeches and Writings by Abraham Lincoln, 1859-1865 |first=Don E. |last=Fehrenbacher|publisher=Library of America |isbn=0940450631\n|year=1989 |quote=either the Missouri line extended, or Douglas' and Eli Thayer's Pop.

In his [[Lincoln's First Inaugural|First Inaugural]] Address, Lincoln declared, "I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments," arguing further that the purpose of the [[United States Constitution]] was "to form a more perfect union" than the [[Articles of Confederation]] which were ''explicitly'' perpetual, thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?\n\nAlso in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the pending [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which had already passed Congress. This amendment, which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, had more appeal to the critical border states than to the states that had already declared their separation.\n\nBy the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established fact, and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. No compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible. Buchanan might have allowed the southern states to secede, and some Republicans recommended that. However, conservative Democratic nationalists, such as [[Jeremiah S. Black]], [[Joseph Holt]], and [[Edwin M. Stanton]] had taken control of Buchanan's cabinet around January 1, 1861, and refused to accept secession. Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader adopted this position by March 1861: the Union could not be dismantled. Believing that a peaceful solution was still possible, Lincoln decided to not take any action against the South unless the Unionists themselves were attacked first. This finally happened in April 1861.\n\nHistorian [[Allan Nevins]] argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war. He "temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis", overestimated the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South and border states, and misunderstood the conditional support of Unionists in the border states.<ref>{{cite book|title=The War for the Union Volume I.....The Improvised War 1861-1862|author=Nevins, Allan|publisher=Konecky & Konecky|date=1971-09-01|isbn=1568522967|page=29|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/warfortheunionvo010749mbp/warfortheunionvo010749mbp_djvu.txt |format=txt}}</ref> In connection with Nevins's conclusions, it is interesting to note an incident from this period reported in the memoirs of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. Then a civilian, Sherman visited Lincoln in the White House during inauguration week, with his brother, Ohio Republican John Sherman. This meeting left the future General Sherman "sadly disappointed" at Lincoln's seeming failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and the South was "'preparing for war.'"<ref>WTS Memoirs 185-86 (Lib. of America ed., 1990).</ref>\n\n===Fighting begins: 1861&ndash;1862===\n{{main|American Civil War}}\nIn April 1861, after Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] were fired upon and forced to surrender, Lincoln called on the governors of every state to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and "preserve the Union," which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. [[Virginia]], which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Arkansas]].\n\nThe slave states of [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]] did not secede.  Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery. After the fighting started, he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas and held in military prisons without trial.  Over 18,000 were arrested, though none were executed. One, [[Clement Vallandigham]], was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (''see'': [[Ex parte Merryman]]). \n\nLincoln had to protect the nation's capital city. In May, angry secessionist mobs in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], a city to the north of Washington, [[Baltimore riot of 1861|fought with Union troops traveling south]].  [[George William Brown]], the [[List of mayors of Baltimore, Maryland|Mayor of Baltimore]], and other suspect Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned at [[Fort McHenry]].\n\n===Emancipation Proclamation===\n{{main|Abraham Lincoln on slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}\n\nLincoln maintained that the powers of his administration to end slavery were limited by the Constitution. He expected to bring about the eventual extinction of slavery by stopping its further expansion into any U.S. territory, and by convincing states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] if the state would outlaw slavery (an offer that took effect only in Washington, D.C.). Guelzo says Lincoln believed that shrinking slavery in this way would make it uneconomical, and place it back on the road to eventual extinction that the Founders had envisioned.<ref>  Mackubin Thomas Owens, [http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp "The Liberator," ''National Review'' (March 8, 2004) reviewing Allen C.

"That if any person shall hereafter incite, set on foot, assist, or engage in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States, or the laws thereof, or shall give aid or comfort thereto, or shall engage in, or give aid and comfort to, any such existing rebellion or insurrection, and be convicted thereof, such person shall be punished by imprisonment for a period not exceeding ten years, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and by the liberation of all his slaves...." {{cite web |url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/conact2.htm |title=text of the Second Confiscation Act |accessdate=2008-12-08}}  </ref> The goal was to weaken the rebellion, which was led and controlled by slave owners. While it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery (the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] did that), the Act showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. In that same month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.\n\nIn a shrewdly penned August reply to an editorial by Horace Greeley in the influential ''New York Tribune'', with a draft of the Proclamation already on Lincoln's desk, the president subordinated the goal of ending slavery to the cause of preserving the Union, while, at the same time, preparing the public for emancipation being incomplete at first. Lincoln had decided at this point that he could not win the war without freeing the slaves, and so it was a necessity "to do more to help the cause":<ref> For analysis of the letter see Carwardine, ''Lincoln'' p 209</ref>\n\n{{quote|I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be "the Union as it was."&nbsp;... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views. I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm|title=Letter to Horace Greeley|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online}}</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Emancipation Proclamation]], announced on September 22, 1862 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not already under Union control. As Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all of them in Confederate territory (over three million) were freed. Lincoln later said: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." The proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal. Lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/hodges.htm|title=Letter to Albert G.

In the end, the state executives fully supported the president's Proclamation and also suggested the removal of General [[George B.

He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. As [[Frederick Douglass]] observed, Lincoln was, "The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself, of the difference of color."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass|author=Douglass, Frederick|publisher=Digital Scanning|month=April |year=2001|isbn=1582183678}}</ref>\n\n===Gettysburg Address===\n{{main|Gettysburg Address}}\nAlthough the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was a Union victory, it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to Lincoln's war effort. As the Union Army decreased in numbers due to casualties, more soldiers were needed to replace the ranks. Lincoln's 1863 military drafts were considered "odious" among many in the north, particularly immigrants. The [[New York Draft Riots]] of July, 1863 were the most notable manifestation of this discontent.\n\nWriting to Lincoln in September 1863, the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]], [[Andrew Curtin]], warned that political sentiments were turning against Lincoln and the war effort:\n\n{{quote|If the election were to occur now, the result would be extremely doubtful, and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result, my impression is, the chances would be against us.

In just over two minutes, Lincoln invoked the principles of human equality espoused by the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] and redefined the Civil War as a struggle not merely for the [[United States|Union]], but as "a new birth of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]]" that would bring true equality to all of its citizens, and that would also create a unified nation in which [[states' rights]] were no longer dominant.\n\nBeginning with the now-iconic phrase "Four [[20 (number)|score]] and seven years ago...", Lincoln referred to the events of the [[Civil War]] and described the ceremony at Gettysburg as an opportunity not only to consecrate the grounds of a cemetery, but also to dedicate the living to the struggle to ensure that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth".\n\nDespite the speech's prominent place in the history and popular culture of the United States, the exact wording of the speech is disputed.

Fessenden|William Fessenden]], [[Edwin M. Stanton|Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] and [[Gideon Welles]] take a swing at the Lincoln administration]]\nThe war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and occupied nearly all of his time. He had a contentious relationship with General [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]], who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and after the retirement of [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861. Despite his inexperience in military affairs, Lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy. His priorities were twofold: to ensure that Washington, D.C. was well defended; and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press. McClellan, a youthful [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service, took a more cautious approach. He took several months to plan and execute his [[Peninsula Campaign]], with the objective of capturing [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[James River (Virginia)|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York Rivers]]. McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.\n\nMcClellan, a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his ''Harrison's Landing Letter'', where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. But Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the [[Sioux]].<ref>Thomas, "Abraham Lincoln: A Biography'' (1952) pp 335-8, 346.</ref>\n\n[[Image:A&TLincoln.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 1864 [[Mathew Brady]] photo depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]]]]\n\nPanicked by Lee's invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the [[Battle of Antietam]] (September 1862). The ensuing Union victory enabled Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation, but he relieved McClellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]] to head the Army of the Potomac. Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was stunningly defeated at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Joseph Hooker]] was given the command, despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/hookbio.htm|title=Joseph Hooker|publisher=Civil War Home}}</ref> Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] (May 1863), and relieved of command early in the subsequent [[Gettysburg Campaign]] replaced by [[George Meade]].\n\nAfter the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Grant already had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including the battles of Vicksburg and [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]]. Responding to criticism of Grant, Lincoln replied, "I can't spare this man. He fights."<ref>Thomas, "Abraham Lincoln: A Biography'' (1952) p. 315.</ref> Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864 with a strategy of a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], but by proportionately higher Confederate losses. The high casualty figures alarmed the nation and after Grant lost a third of his army Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were. "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer," replied Grant. Lincoln and the Republican party mobilized support throughout the North, backed Grant to the hilt, and replaced his losses.<ref>Thomas, "Abraham Lincoln: A Biography'' (1952) pp 422-24.</ref> The Confederacy was out of replacements so Lee's army shrank with every battle, forcing it back to trenches outside [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]]. In April 1865 Lee's army finally crumbled under Grant's pounding, and Richmond fell. \n\n[[Image:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln, in a [[top hat]], with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]] at Antietam]]\nLincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure — such as plantations, railroads, and bridges — hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. This allowed Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan|Sheridan]] to destroy plantations and towns in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and South Carolina. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by Sherman's own estimate.<ref>{{cite book|title=The United States: A History of the Republic|author=Davidson, James West|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|month=April |year=1990|isbn=0139436979|page=446}}</ref>\n\nLincoln possessed a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and understood the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities. He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant. Only then could he insist on using [[African American]] troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters.\n\nThroughout the war, Lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals. He visited battle sites frequently, and seemed fascinated by scenes of war. During [[Jubal Anderson Early]]'s [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; a captain shouted at him, Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!"<ref> The Captain was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes]]; Thomas, "Abraham Lincoln: A Biography'' (1952) p. 434.</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\n{{main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}\nReconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the "moderates" regarding Reconstruction policy, and was usually opposed by the [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republicans]], under [[Thaddeus Stevens]] in the House and [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Benjamin Wade]] in the Senate (though he cooperated with these men on most other issues). Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind Union lines. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.bartleby.com/43/37.html|title=Proclamation of Amnesty|publisher=[[Bartleby.com]]|year=1863}}</ref> Critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered. Of special importance were [[Tennessee]], where Lincoln appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as governor, and [[Louisiana]], where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10% of the voters agreed to it. The Radicals thought this policy too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln [[Pocket veto|pocket-vetoed]] the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.<ref>{{harvnb|Donald|1995|loc=&sect;20}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LincolnEntersRichmond.jpg|thumb|left|160px|President Abraham Lincoln enters [[Richmond, Virginia]] after the city's capture by Union forces, symbolically ending the American Civil War with the capture of the Confederate Capital.]] -->\nNear the end of the war, Lincoln made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to visit Richmond after it was taken by the Union forces and to make a public gesture of sitting at [[Jefferson Davis|Jefferson Davis's]] own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, "I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him." When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy."<ref>{{harvnb|Donald|1995|pp=576, 580}};{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/richmond.htm|title=President Lincoln Enters Richmond, 1865|publisher=Eyewitness to History}}</ref> Lincoln arrived back in Washington on the evening of April 9, 1865, the day Lee surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House]] in Virginia. The war was effectively over. The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelincolnlog.org/view/show_date?day=09&month=04&year=1865|title=The Lincoln Log, April 9, 1865.}}</ref>\n\n==Home front==\n===Redefining Republicanism===\n[[Image:Abraham Lincoln half length seated, April 10, 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the last photographs of Lincoln, likely taken in February 1865]]\nLincoln's [[rhetoric]] defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. The [[Gettysburg Address]] defied Lincoln's own prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here." His second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted.\n\nIn recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's use of and redefinition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]], Lincoln shifted emphasis to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the foundation of American political values — what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 399}}</ref> The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential [[Cooper Union speech]], "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Lost Soul of American Politics: Virtue, Self-Interest, and the Foundations of Liberalism|author=Diggins, John P.|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|date=1986-08-15|isbn=0226148777|page=307}}</ref> His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.<ref>{{harvnb|Foner|1970|p= 215}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McPherson|1992|pp=61–64}}</ref> Nevertheless, in 1861 Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a "republican form of government" in every state.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p= 263}}</ref> That duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\nIn his [[Gettysburg Address]] Lincoln redefined the American nation, arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." He declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality, "that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." By emphasizing the centrality of the nation, he rebuffed the claims of [[state sovereignty]]. While some critics say Lincoln moved too far and too fast, they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked "a new founding of the nation."<ref>{{harvnb|Wills|1993|p= 39}}</ref>\n\n===Civil liberties suspended===\nDuring the Civil War, Lincoln appropriated powers no previous President had wielded: he used his war powers to proclaim a [[Union blockade|blockade]], suspended the writ of [[habeas corpus]], spent money before Congress appropriated it, and imprisoned 18,000 suspected Confederate sympathizers without trial.<ref>Neeley (1992)</ref>\n\n===Domestic measures===\nLincoln believed in the Whig theory of the presidency, which left Congress to write the laws while he signed them, [[veto]]ing only those bills that threatened his war powers. Thus, he signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[university|universities]] in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869. Other important legislation involved economic matters, including the first [[income tax]] and higher [[tariff]]s. Also included was the creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]]s of 1863, 1864, and 1865, which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system. Congress created and Lincoln approved the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] in 1862, although that institution would not become a Cabinet-level department until 1889.\n\nThe Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the [[United States Note]], the first [[banknote|paper currency]] in United States history. This was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war.\n\nDuring the war, Lincoln's [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] effectively controlled all [[cotton]] trade in the occupied South — the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy.\n\nIn 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], to put down the "[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]" in [[Minnesota]]. Presented with 303 [[death warrant]]s for convicted [[Sioux#Isanti (Santee or Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers; Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for [[death penalty|execution]] (one was later [[reprieve]]d).\n\nPrior to Lincoln's presidency, the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]], while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had only been proclaimed by the federal government sporadically.  The last such proclamation was during [[James Madison|James Madison's]] presidency.  In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November to be a day of Thanksgiving, and the holiday has been celebrated annually at that time ever since.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/source/sb2/sb2w.htm 1863 Thanksgiving proclamation] from National Park Service</ref>\n\n==Medical history==\nIllnesses included: [[frostbite|frostbitten]] feet, [[malaria]], [[physical trauma]] and [[smallpox]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g16.htm|title=Maladies and Conditions|publisher=Doctor Zebra}}</ref> Claims that Lincoln had [[syphilis]] about 1835 have been controversial, but a recent analysis finds them credible.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vidal, Gore|title=Communications|journal=[[American Historical Review]]|month=February |year=1991|pages=324–326}} See also: {{cite journal|author=Fehrenbacher, Don E.|title=Communications|journal=[[American Historical Review]]|month=February |year=1991|pages=326–328}} and {{cite book|author=Sotos, JG|title=The Physical Lincoln Sourcebook|location=[[Mount Vernon]], [[Virginia|VA]]|publisher=Mt.

He reached his adult height of {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m}} no later than age 21. Friends noticed his arms, legs, hands, and feet were long. Although well muscled as a young adult, he was always thin. Fragmentary evidence says he weighed around 170&nbsp;pounds before the Presidency, but lost weight while in the White House. Based on Lincoln's unusual physical appearance, Dr. Abraham Gordon proposed in 1962 that Lincoln had [[Marfan syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gordon AM.

The "mole" on Lincoln's right cheek, the asymmetry of his face, his large jaw, his drooping eyelid, and "pseudo-depression" are also suggested as manifestations of MEN2B. Lincoln's longevity is the principal challenge to the MEN2B theory, which could be proven by DNA testing.\n\nMany historians have suggested that Lincoln suffered from depression throughout his life. Many people attribute this illness to the losses of his mother and sister very early in his life. He lost the two women he loved the most when he was extremely young. This depression was also reinforced later in his life by the losses of his stepmother and his very first love, Ann Rutledge. Other people have suggested that he was simply melancholy in nature. They argue that this can be seen in some of his actions as both a young boy and adult. Some of these actions included withdrawing himself from a crowd to read when he was a little boy, and even retreating to his privacy to find a solution to a problem. As an adult, Lincoln would often slip into depression, and emerge a short time later full of humor and happiness. Some people suggest that Lincoln's humor was actually a healthy way to cope with his depression. <ref>Goodwin, Doris Kearns. ''Team of Rivals''. New York, NY.

As a lone bodyguard wandered, and Lincoln sat in his state box (Box 7) in the balcony, Booth crept up behind the President and waited for what he thought would be the funniest line of the play ("You sock-dologizing old man-trap"), hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot. When the laughter began, Booth jumped into the box and aimed a single-shot, round-slug 0.44 caliber Derringer at his head, firing at point-blank range. Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth but was cut by Booth's knife. Booth then leaped to the stage and shouted "''[[Sic semper tyrannis]]!''" ({{lang-la|Thus always to tyrants}}) and escaped, despite a broken leg suffered in the leap.<ref name=Townsend>{{cite book|author=Townsend, George Alfred|title=The Life, Crime and Capture of John Wilkes Booth|location=New York|publisher=[[Dick and Fitzgerald]]|year=1865}}</ref> A twelve-day manhunt ensued, in which Booth was chased by Federal agents (under the direction of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M.

There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by "an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning." It was Lincoln’s reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs.<ref name = "zsafth">{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=20}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Miller|2002|pp=57–59}}</ref>\n\nLincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject [[religion|organized religion]], but the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] "doctrine of necessity" would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846 Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as "that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control."<ref>{{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=15}}</ref> In April 1864, in justifying his actions in regard to Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, "I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it."<ref>{{harvnb|Donald|1995|p=514}}</ref>\n\nAs Lincoln matured, and especially during his term as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|pp=251–254}}</ref> After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary:\n\n{{quote|The [[will (philosophy)|will]] of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party&mdash;and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose. I am almost ready to say this is probably true&mdash;that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his mere quiet power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=254}}</ref>}}\n\nLincoln’s religious [[skepticism]] was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the [[John Locke|Lockean]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and classical liberalism, especially [[economic liberalism]].<ref name = "zsafth"/> Consistent with the common practice of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies.<ref>{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|p=194}}</ref> In a February 22, 1861 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia Lincoln said,\n\n{{quote|I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&nbsp;… It was not the mere matter of the separation of the Colonies from the motherland; but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men. This is a sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaffa|2000|p=258}}</ref>}}\n\nHe found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] platform of the [[Know Nothing]]s. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population.<ref>{{harvnb|Guelzo|1999|pp=194–195}}</ref>\n\nIt was the Declaration of Independence, rather than the Bible, that Lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery. He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it was, foremost, a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation.<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|2002|p=297}}</ref>\n\n==Health and personality==\nLincoln was regularly reported to suffer from "melancholy". Some biographers have controversily diagnosed him with [[depression]], [[bipolar disorder]] and [[Marfan syndrome]], but these theories have generally been dismissed.<ref>http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g16.htm#15</ref> Mainly, his reported "melancholy" affected at times of great political stress or warfare and after losing a loved one, neither of which are unusual. Mary Lincoln felt her husband to be too trusting and his "melancholy" also struck at times he was betrayed or unsupported by those he put faith in.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=Ja16KVw5CqEC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Lincoln+too+trusting&source=bl&ots=NLODGE8vPr&sig=tLGTwsu0Gt2ZLgx-2u--ZO5nVpk&hl=en&ei=NwawSYyUEuH8tgf_-ZCBBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result</ref> Unlike the quiet, deep voice later used by impersonators and actors, Lincoln reportedly had a strikingly high-pitched speaking voice which aided him at times when he needed to be heard by crowds of thousands before the existence of microphones. Despite his legendary talent as orator, he was said to have been shy and awkward in intimate social situations, especially in his youth. As a young man, Lincoln was known for his great physical strength, but was afflicted with illness and had lost over 20 pounds by the time he was elected president. His weight loss has been attributed to his possibly having experienced a genetic cancer syndrome.<ref>http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g16.htm#30</ref> Despite having multiple illnesses in his life, his health up until middle age was not particularly poor for his day.<ref>http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g16.htm</ref>\n\n==Legacy and memorials==\n{{see|Cultural depictions of Abraham Lincoln}}\n[[Image:TheApotheosisLincolnAndWashington1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Apotheosis'' of Abraham Lincoln, greeted by [[George Washington]] in heaven (an 1860s work)]]\nLincoln's death made the President a [[martyr]] to many. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|greatest presidents in U.S. history]], often appearing in the first position. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as personifying classical values of honesty and integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general.\n\nMany American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]-supporting [[Log Cabin Republicans]] to the [[insurance]] corporation [[Lincoln National Corporation]].

Also, the [[Liberty ship]] SS ''Nancy Hanks'' was named for his mother. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the American faction of the [[International Brigades]] named themselves the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]].\n\nLincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the [[Lincoln, Nebraska|capital of Nebraska]]. [[Lincoln, Illinois]], is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President. Lincoln's name and image appear in numerous places. These include the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., the U.S. [[United States five-dollar bill|Lincoln $5 bill]] and the [[Lincoln cent]], Lincoln's sculpture on the [[Mount Rushmore]], and the [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]] in Springfield, Illinois. In addition, [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem, Illinois]] (a reconstruction of Lincoln's early adult hometown), [[Ford's Theatre]], and Petersen House (where he died) are all preserved as museums. The Lincoln Shrine in [[Redlands, California]], is located behind the A.K. Smiley Public Library. The [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]] for Illinois is ''Land of Lincoln''; the slogan has appeared continuously on nearly all [[Vehicle registration plates of Illinois|Illinois license plates]] issued since 1954.\n\n[[County (United States)|Counties]] in 18 [[U.S. state]]s ([[Lincoln County, Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Lincoln County, Colorado|Colorado]], [[Lincoln County, Idaho|Idaho]], [[Lincoln County, Kansas|Kansas]], [[Lincoln County, Maine|Maine]], [[Lincoln County, Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Lincoln County, Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[Lincoln County, Montana|Montana]], [[Lincoln County, Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Nevada]], [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[Lincoln County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Lincoln County, Oregon|Oregon]], [[Lincoln County, West Virginia|West Virginia]], [[Lincoln County, Washington|Washington]], [[Lincoln County, Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Wyoming]]) are named after Lincoln.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's birthday, February 12, was formerly a national holiday, now commemorated as [[Presidents Day (United States)|Presidents Day]]. However, it is still observed in Illinois and many other states as a separate legal holiday, [[Lincoln's Birthday]]. A dozen states have legal holidays celebrating the third Monday in February as Presidents Day as a combination Washington-Lincoln Day.\n\nTo commemorate his upcoming 200th birthday in February 2009, Congress established the [[Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission]] (ALBC) in 2000. Dedicated to renewing American appreciation of Lincoln's legacy, the 15-member commission is made up of lawmakers and scholars and also features an advisory board of over 130 various Lincoln historians and enthusiasts. Located at [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the ALBC is the organizing force behind numerous tributes, programs and cultural events highlighting a two-year celebration scheduled to begin in February 2008 at Lincoln's birthplace: [[Hodgenville, Kentucky|Hodgenville]], [[Kentucky]].\n\nLincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site]] in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]] opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits.

He wrote on many subjects, including physics, [[metaphysics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, logic, rhetoric, politics, government, ethics, biology and zoology.\n\nTogether with Plato and [[Socrates]] (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in [[Western philosophy]]. He was the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality and aesthetics, logic and science, politics and metaphysics. Aristotle's views on the [[Aristotelian physics|physical sciences]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the [[Renaissance]], although they were ultimately replaced by [[modern physics]]. In the biological sciences, some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the nineteenth century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which were incorporated in the late nineteenth century into modern [[formal logic]]. In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] had a profound influence on [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)|philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions]] in the [[Middle Ages]], and it continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Eastern Orthodox theology]], and the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.\n\nThough Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues ([[Cicero]] described his literary style as "a river of gold"), it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one-third of the original works have survived.<ref>[[Jonathan Barnes]], "Life and Work" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), p. 9.</ref>\n\n==Life==\nAristotle was born in [[Stageira]], [[Chalcidice]], in 384 BC, about 55 km east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Aristotle: The Great Philosophers | author = McLeish, Kenneth | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-415-92392-1 | page = 5}}</ref> His father [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]]. Aristotle was trained and educated as a member of the [[aristocracy]]. At about the age of eighteen, he went to [[Athens]] to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]]. Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years, not leaving until after Plato's death in 347 BC. He then traveled with [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece) [[Pythias]]. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] to become tutor to [[Alexander the Great]] in 343 B.C.<ref>Bertrand Russell, "A History of Western Philosophy", Simon & Schuster, 1972</ref>\n\nDuring his time as the head of Macedon's royal academy, Aristotle gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]]. In his ''Politics'', Aristotle states that only one thing could justify monarchy, and that was if the virtue of the king and his family were greater than the virtue of the rest of the citizens put together. Tactfully, he included the young prince and his father in that category. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be 'a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants'.<ref>Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', 1991 University of California Press, Ltd. Oxford, England. Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, p.58-59</ref> Near the end of Alexander's life he began to suspect plots, and threatened Aristotle in letters. Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexander's pretense of divinity, and the king had executed Aristotle's grand-nephew [[Callisthenes]] as a traitor. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but there is little evidence for this.<ref>Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', 1991 University of California Press, Ltd. Oxford, England. Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, p.379,459</ref>\n\nBy 335 BC he had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died, and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of [[Stageira]], who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the [[Suda]], he also had an [[eromenos]], [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].<ref>William George Smith,''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. 3, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html p. 88]</ref>\n\nIt is during this period in Athens from 335 B.C. to 323 B.C. when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.<ref>Bertrand Russell, "A History of Western Philosophy", Simon & Schuster, 1972</ref> Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived. The works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]] (On the Soul)'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.\n\nAristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, economics, [[embryology]], geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge. It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Neill\n | first =Alex\n | coauthors =Aaron Ridley\n | title =The Philosophy of Art: Readings Ancient and Modern\n | publisher =McGraw Hill\n | year =1995\n | page =488\n | url =http://www.amazon.com/dp/0070461929/\n}}</ref>\n\nUpon Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared. [[Eurymedon the hierophant]] denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor. Aristotle fled the city to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis]], explaining, "I will not allow the Athenians to [[Trial of Socrates|sin twice against philosophy]],"<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Jones\n | first =W.T.\n | title =The Classical Mind: A History of Western Philosophy\n | publisher =Harcourt Brace Jovanovich\n | year =1980\n | page =216\n | url =http://www.amazon.com/dp/0155383124/\n}}, cf. ''Vita Marciana'' 41.</ref> a reference to Athens's prior trial and execution of Socrates. However, he died in Euboea of natural causes within the year (in 322 BC).

[[Kant]] stated in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference.\n\n===History===\nAristotle "says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'".<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Bocheński\n | first =I. M.\n | title =Ancient Formal Logic\n | publisher =North-Holland Publishing Company\n | year =1951\n | location =Amsterdam\n}}</ref> However, Plato reports that [[syntax]] was devised before him, by [[Prodicus of Ceos]], who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a [[deduction]] system, he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his [[dialectic]].<ref name="Bocheński, 1951">Bocheński, 1951.</ref> Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', where he introduced his division method.<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Rose\n | first =Lynn E.\n | title =Aristotle's Syllogistic\n | publisher =Charles C Thomas Publisher\n | year =1968\n | location =Springfield\n}}</ref>\n\n===Analytics and the ''Organon''===\n{{main|Organon}}\nWhat we today call ''Aristotelian logic'', Aristotle himself would have labeled "analytics". The term "logic" he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:\n#''Categories''\n#''On Interpretation''\n#''Prior Analytics''\n#''Posterior Analytics''\n#''Topics''\n#''On Sophistical Refutations''\n\nThe order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations). There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.''.<ref name="Bocheński, 1951"/>\n\n==Aristotle's scientific method==\n[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]''<!-- this should link to an article about the famous artwork -->, a fresco by [[Raphael]]. Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, while holding a copy of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in his hand, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]].]]\n{{details|Aristotle's theory of universals}}\n\nLike his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle, however, found the universal in [[particular]] things, which he called the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) to a contemplation of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, "form" still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is "instantiated" in a particular substance (see ''[[Aristotle#Universals and particulars|Universals and particulars]]'', below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' principles.<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Jori\n | first =Alberto\n | title =Aristotele\n | publisher =Bruno Mondadori Editore\n | year =2003\n | location =Milano\n}}</ref>\n\nIn Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the [[scientific method]]. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.\n\nIn the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as "science". Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "[[scientific method]]". For Aristotle, "all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical" (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, [[mathematics]] and metaphysics.\n\nIf logic (or "analytics") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics, Mathematics, (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.\n\nIn the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.\n\nAristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the sixteenth century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.\n[[Image:Perseid Meteor.jpg|thumb|A green and red [[Perseids|Perseid]] meteor is striking the sky just below the Milky Way in August 2007.]]\nHis writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.<ref>Aristotle, ''History of Animals'', 2.3.</ref> In a similar vein, [[John Philoponus]], and later [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref> On the other hand, Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays," pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given "current astronomical demonstrations" that "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then...the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them."<ref>Aristotle, ''Meteorology'' 1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes.</ref>\n\nIn places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched [[reason]]. Today's [[scientific method]] assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.\n\nAristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 1500s. From the 3rd century to the 1500s, the dominant view held that the Earth was the center of the universe ([[geocentrism]]).\n\nSince he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.<ref>[[John Burnet (classicist)|Burent, John.]] 1928. ''Platonism'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103-104.</ref> However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.\n\n==Physics==\n{{main|Physics (Aristotle)}}\n===The five elements===\n{{main|Classical element}}\n*[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], which is hot and dry.\n*[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], which is cold and dry.\n*[[Air (classical element)|Air]], which is hot and wet.\n*[[Water (classical element)|Water]], which is cold and wet.\n*[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).\n\nEach of the four earthly elements has its natural place; the earth at the centre of the universe, then water, then air, then fire. When they are out of their natural place they have natural motion, requiring no external cause, which is towards that place; so bodies sink in water, air bubbles rise up, rain falls, flame rises in air. The heavenly element has perpetual circular motion.\n\n===Causality, The Four Causes===<!-- This section is linked from [[Retrocausality]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\n{{main|Four causes}}\n*The [[material cause]] is that from which a thing comes into existence as from its part, constituents, substratum or materials. This reduces the explanation of causes to the parts (factors, elements, constituents, ingredients) forming the whole (system, structure, compound, complex, composite, or combination), a relationship known as the part-whole causation. Simply put it is the influence of the material substances on the event. So imagine two dominos, the first of which is lighter. The first is knocked over into the second but does not have enough power to knock it over; this is material cause.\n*The [[formal cause]] tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put it is the influence of the form (essence) of the things on the event. So take the two dominos again except this time the second is shaped to prevent it from falling *eg. triangular.* this is formal cause.\n*The [[efficient cause]] is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of "cause" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. More simply again that which immediately sets the thing in motion. So take the two dominos this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over. This is effectively efficient cause.\n*The [[final cause]] is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, and all that gives purpose to behaviour.\n\nAdditionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event (not necessarily a mental goal). Taking our two dominos, it requires someone to intentionally knock the dominos over as they cannot fall themselves.\n\nAristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.\n\nAll further investigations of causality will consist of imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes, such as final > efficient > material > formal ([[Thomas Aquinas]]), or of restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance) or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores).\n\n===Optics===\nAristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. He rejected the theory of [[Plato]] that light rays were emitted from the eyes. Additionaly, the earliest known written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in ''Problemata''. Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the tiny hole (the aperture in modern terms) and the surface with the image increased, the image was amplified. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[diaphragm]].<ref>[http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm Optics and ancient Greeks]</ref>\n\n===Chance and spontaneity===\nSpontaneity and chance are causes of effects. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]. It is "from what is spontaneous" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of "chance" it might be better to think of "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.\n\nThere is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names "luck", that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. "What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance".<ref>Aristotle, ''Physics'' 2.6</ref>\n\n==Metaphysics==\n{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}\nAristotle defines metaphysics as "the knowledge of [[immaterial]] being," or of "being in the highest degree of abstraction." He refers to metaphysics as "first philosophy", as well as "the theologic science."\n\n===Substance, potentiality and actuality===\nAristotle examines the concept of substance and essence (''[[ousia]]'') in his ''Metaphysics'', Book VII and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. As he proceeds to the book VIII, he concludes that the matter of the substance is the [[substratum]] or the stuff of which it is composed, ''e.g.'' the matter of the house are the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house. While the form of the substance, is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]). The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10-30</ref>\n\nWith regard to the change (''[[kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] and [[On Generation and Corruption]] 319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from: 1) growth and diminution, which is change in quantity; 2) locomotion, which is change in space; and 3) alteration, which is change in quality.\n\nThe coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|potentiality]] (''[[dynamis]]'') and [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|actuality]] (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form.\n\nReferring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''[[poiein]]'') or 'be acted upon' (''[[paschein]]''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate - being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise - acting).\n\nActuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that actuality is when the seed of the plant becomes a plant.\n\n" For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see."<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5-10</ref>\n\nIn conclusion, the matter of the house is its potentiality and the form is its actuality. The [[formal cause]] (''aitia'') then of that change from potential to actual house, is the [[reason]] (''logos'') of the house builder and the [[final cause]] is the end, namely the house itself. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.\n\nWith this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, ''e.g.'', what is that makes the man one? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a-b</ref>\n\n===Universals and particulars===\n{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}\n\nAristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.\n\nPlato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form. [[Bertrand Russell]] is a contemporary philosopher that agreed with Plato on the existence of "uninstantiated universals".\n\nAristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.\n\nOne way for contemporary philosophers to justify this position is by asserting the [[eleatic]] principle.\n\nIn addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.\n\n==Biology and medicine==\nIn Aristotelian science, most especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals, but not humans and his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.\n\n===Empirical research program===\n[[Image:Octo2.jpg|thumb|Octopus swimming]]\n[[Image:Torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|''Torpedo fuscomaculata'']]\nAristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[Lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] ([[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]) and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''[[Octopus]]'', ''Sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[Argonauta argo]]''). His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the nineteenth century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ([[selachians]]).<ref name="Singer, Charles 1931">Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology''. Oxford 1931.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|Leopard shark]]\n\nAnother good example of his methods comes from the ''Generation of Animals'' in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.\n\nHe gave accurate descriptions of [[ruminant]]s' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]] ''[[Mustelus mustelus]]''.<ref>Emily Kearns, "Animals, knowledge about," in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.</ref>\n\n===Classification of living things===\nAristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the nineteenth century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he was not to know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[haemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of [[Linnaeus]], who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).\n\nFor [[Charles Singer]], "Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''"<ref name="Singer, Charles 1931"/> Aristotle's ''History of Animals'' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical "[[Great chain of being|Ladder of Life]]" (''scala naturae''), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.<ref>Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.</ref>\n\nAristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[formal cause]]s, guided all natural processes. Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that "no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns," and "a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen," Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had a multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.<ref>Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 43-44</ref>\n\nIn a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]].<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 201-202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''</ref> His system had eleven grades, arranged according "to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality", expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.\n\n===Theory of biological forms and souls===\nAristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.\n\nHe placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.<ref>Aristotle, ''De Anima'' II 3</ref>\n\nAristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.<ref>Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 45</ref> Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].<ref>Guthrie, ''A History of Greek Philosophy'' Vol. 1 pp. 348</ref>\n\nHis analysis of procreation is frequently criticized on the grounds that it presupposes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive, lumpen female element; it is on these grounds that Aristotle is considered by some feminist critics to have been a [[Misogyny|misogynist]].<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Harding\n | first =Sandra\n | coauthors =Merrill B.

Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel.\n\nRather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the [[efficient cause]]. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90-91; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 46</ref>\n\n===Influence on Hellenistic medicine===\n{{details|Medicine in ancient Greece}}\nAfter Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.<ref>Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'' pp 252</ref> It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.\n\nThe first medical teacher at Alexandria [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.<ref>Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 56</ref> Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] claimed that there was "nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance."<ref>Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90-94; quotation from p 91</ref> Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.<ref>Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'', p 252</ref>\n\n==Practical philosophy==\n===Ethics===\n{{main|Aristotelian ethics}}\n\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical science, i.e., one mastered by doing rather than merely reasoning. Further, Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge (such as metaphysics or [[epistemology]]) but is general knowledge. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, ''[[Nichomachean Ethics]]'', in which he outlines what is commonly called [[virtue ethics]].\n\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that man must have a function uncommon to anything else, and that this function must be an activity of the soul. Aristotle identified the best activity of the soul as [[eudaimonia]]: a happiness or joy that pervades the good life. Aristotle taught that to achieve the good life, one must live a balanced life and avoid excess. This balance, he taught, varies among different persons and situations, and exists as a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] between two vices - one an excess and one a deficiency.\n\n===Politics===\n{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}\nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.<ref>{{cite book | last =Ebenstein | first =Alan | coauthors =William Ebenstein | title =Introduction to Political Thinkers | publisher =Wadsworth Group | year =2002 | page =59}}</ref> Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior to the [[family]] which in turn is prior to the individual, i.e., last in the order of becoming, but first in the order of being <!-- (1253a19-24) -->. He is also famous for his statement that "man is by nature a political animal." Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an [[organism]] rather than like a [[machine]], and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others.\n\nIt should be noted that the modern understanding of a political community is that of the state. However, the state was foreign to Aristotle. He referred to political communities as cities. Aristotle understood a city as a political "partnership" <!-- (1252a1) --> and not one of a [[social contract]] (or compact) or a political community as understood by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. Subsequently, a city is created not to avoid injustice or for economic stability <!-- (1280b29-31) -->, but rather to live a good life: "The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together" <!-- (1281a1-3) -->. This can be distinguished from the social contract theory which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences."<ref>For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomacean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, K. (1957) "Aristotle Discovers the Economy" in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78-115</ref>\n\n===Rhetoric and poetics===\n{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}\nAristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by media, object, and manner.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a</ref> For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation - through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III</ref> Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV</ref>\n\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' comprised two books - one on comedy and one on tragedy - only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, spectacle, and lyric poetry.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI</ref> The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI</ref>\n\nAristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].<ref>Temple, Olivia, and Temple, Robert (translators), [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&pg=PR3&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=0_0 The Complete Fables By Aesop] Penguin Classics, 1998. ISBN 0140446494 Cf. Introduction, pp. xi-xii.</ref>\n\n==Loss of his works==\nAccording to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the "exoteric" and the "esoteric".<ref>[[Jonathan Barnes]], "Life and Work" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), p. 12; Aristotle himself: ''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1102a26-27. Aristotle himself never uses the term "esoteric" or "acroamatic". For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exōterikoi logoi'', see [[W. D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408-410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to "discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic]] school", rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.</ref> Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works (esoteric) intended for the narrower audience of Aristotle's students and other philosophers who were familiar with the jargon and issues typical of the Platonic and Aristotelian schools. Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant - that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (''Fragments'' of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that [[Cicero]] refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as "a river of gold";<ref>{{cite web\n | last =Cicero\n | first =Marcus Tullius\n | title ="flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles"\n | work =Academica\n | date =106BC-43BC\n | url =http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/gutenberg/1/4/9/7/14970/14970-h/14970-h.htm#BkII_119\n | accessdate =25 January 2007 |dateformat=dmy}}</ref> it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us.<ref>Barnes, "Life and Work", p. 12.</ref> However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle's extant works.<ref>Barnes, "Roman Aristotle", in Gregory Nagy, ''Greek Literature'', Routledge 2001, vol. 8, p. 174 n. 240.</ref>\n\nOne major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us?<ref>The definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, "Roman Aristotle".</ref> The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' and [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]''.<ref>"Sulla."</ref> The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor [[Theophrastus]], who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]]. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the first century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to [[Rome]], where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] and then by philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].\n\n[[Carnes Lord]] attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides "the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C."<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Lord\n |first=Carnes\n |title=Introduction to the Politics, by Aristotle\n |publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]\n |year=1984\n |location=Chicago\n |page=11\n}}</ref> Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair. Second, there is "incontrovertible evidence," Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelean corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelean interpolations in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.\n\nAs the influence of the ''falsafa'' grew in the West, in part due to [[Gerard of Cremona]]'s translations and the spread of [[Averroism]], the demand for Aristotle's works grew. [[William of Moerbeke]] translated a number of them into Latin. When [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his [[theology]], working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in [[Europe]], and ultimately revitalizing European thought through Muslim influence in Spain to fan the embers of the Renaissance.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Early Islamic portrayal of Aristotle]]\n[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|upright|thumb|Aristotle portrayed in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' as a 15th-century-A.D. scholar.]]\nTwenty-three hundred years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He was the founder of [[formal logic]], pioneered the study of [[zoology]], and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34560/Aristotle</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Durant |first=Will |authorlink=Will Durant |title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] |year=1926 (2006) |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc. |location=[[United States]] |isbn=9780671739164 |page= 92}}</ref> Despite these accolades, many of Aristotle's errors held back science considerably. [[Bertrand Russell]] notes that "almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine". Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as "repulsive", and calls his logic "as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy". Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.<ref>Bertrand Russell, "A History of Western Philosophy", Simon & Schuster, 1972</ref>\n\nThe immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Meno]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and [[Theophrastus]]. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained "Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?"<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander''</ref>\n\nAristotle is referred to as "The Philosopher" by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. See ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''At his bedded hed''\n:''Twenty books clothed in blake or red''\n:''Of Aristotle and his philosophie''\nThe Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],\n:''I saw the Master there of those who know,''\n:''Amid the philosophic family,''\n:''By all admired, and by all reverenced;''\n:''There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,''\n:''Who stood beside him closer than the rest.''\n\nThe German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.<ref>Durant, p. 86</ref> However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue - or ''arete'' - of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.<ref>Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy'', Polity Press, 2007, ''passim''.</ref>\n\n==List of Aristotle's works==\n{{main|Corpus Aristotelicum}}\n\n==Notes and References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\nThe secondary literature on Aristotle is vast.

268829509	: ''This article is about the Gershwin composition. For the 1951 musical starring Gene Kelly, see [[An American in Paris (film)]].''\n \n'''''An American in Paris''''' is a [[European-influenced classical music|symphonic]] composition by American composer [[George Gershwin]], composed in 1928. Inspired by time Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]], it is in the form of an extended [[tone poem]] evoking the sights and energy of the [[France|French]] capital in the 1920s. It is one of Gershwin's best-known compositions.\n\nGershwin composed the piece on commission from the [[New York Philharmonic]]. He also did the [[orchestration]]. (He did not orchestrate his musicals.) Gershwin scored ''An American in Paris'' for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], [[saxophone]], and automobile horns. Gershwin brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the [[New York City|New York]] premiere of the composition which took place on December 13, 1928 in [[Carnegie Hall]] with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the New York Philharmonic.\n\nGershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]], noting that: "My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere." When the tone poem moves into the [[blues]], "our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness." But, "nostalgia is not a fatal disease." The American visitor "once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life" and "the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant."\n\n== Instrumentation ==\n''An American in Paris'' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in B flat, [[bass clarinet]] in B flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 taxi horns, [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone saxophone]], and [[String section|strings]].\n\n== Recordings ==\n''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded over the years.  The very first recording was made for [[RCA Victor]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].  Gershwin was on hand to "supervise" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.  Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording.  Later, [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.  In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the music in [[Carnegie Hall]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer.\n\nIn 1951, MGM released a musical comedy, ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]]. Winner of numerous awards, including the 1951 Best Picture Oscar, the film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around Gershwin's symphonic poem (arranged for the film by Johnny Green).\n\nA part of the symphonic composition is also featured in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', released in 1997.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{it}} [http://www.magazzini-sonori.it/esplora_contenuti/fondazione_toscanini/americano_parigi.aspx An American in Paris: listen to the whole symphonic poem] by Gershwin on [http://www.magazzini-sonori.it/ Magazzini-Sonori].\n\n[[Category:Compositions by George Gershwin]]\n[[Category:Symphonic poems|American in Paris, An]]\n\n[[ca:Un americà a París]]\n[[de:Ein Amerikaner in Paris]]\n[[es:Un americano en París (Gershwin)]]\n[[fr:Un Américain à Paris (Gershwin)]]\n[[he:אמריקני בפריז]]\n[[nl:An American in Paris (Gershwin)]]\n[[ja:パリのアメリカ人]]\n[[pl:Amerykanin w Paryżu (Gershwin)]]\n[[sv:An American in Paris (symfonisk dikt)]]\n[[zh:一個美國人在巴黎]]

It was hosted by actor [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and director [[William C. deMille]].\n\nThe [[81st Academy Awards]] honoring the best [[2008 in film|in film for 2008]] was held on Sunday, February 22, 2009 at the [[Kodak Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]] with actor [[Hugh Jackman]] hosting the ceremony for the first time.<ref>http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2008/08.12.12.html Retrieved 2009-02-14.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first awards were presented on May 16, 1929 at a private dinner in Hollywood, with an audience of less than 250 people.<ref name="about2">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index2.html|title=About the Academy Awards <small>(page 2)</small>|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|format=HTML|language=English}}</ref> Since the first year the awards have been publicly broadcast, at first by radio then by TV after 1953.<ref name="about2"/> During the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 p.m. on the night of the awards.

Made of [[gold]]-plated [[britannia metal|britannium]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&nbsp;in (34&nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&nbsp;lb (3.85&nbsp;kg) and depicts a [[knight]] rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusade|crusader's]] [[sword]] standing on a [[reel]] of film with five spokes. The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.oscar.com/legacy/?pn=statuette|title= Oscar Statuette: Legacy|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}</ref> \n\n[[MGM]]'s art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award [[trophy]] by printing the design on scroll.<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2000/00.05.03.html|title= Academy to Commemorate Oscar Designer Cedric Gibbons|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=May 3, 2007|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}</ref> \nIn need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his then wife [[Dolores del Río]] to Mexican film director [[Emilio Fernandez|Emilio "El Indio" Fernández]]. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose naked to create what today is known as the "Oscar". Then, sculptor George Stanley sculpted Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent [[tin]] and 7.5 percent [[copper]] and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway & Sons Foundry in [[Batavia, Illinois]], which also contributed to casting the molds for the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] and [[Emmy Award]]s statuettes for Golnaz Rahimi.

One biography of [[Bette Davis]] claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio|title= Bette Davis biography|publisher= The Internet Movie Database|accessdate = 2007-04-13}}</ref> one of the earliest mentions in print of the term ''Oscar'' dates back to a [[TIME Magazine]] article about the 1934 [[6th Academy Awards]]<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html "Oscars"], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', March 26, 1934</ref> and to Bette Davis's receipt of the award in 1936.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://firstmention.com/oscars.aspx|title= The Oscars, 1936|accessdate = 2008-02-17}}</ref>  [[Walt Disney]] is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. Another claimed origin is that of the Academy's Executive Secretary, [[Margaret Herrick]]<ref>[http://www.oscar.com/oscarhistory/?pn=statuette OSCAR.com - 80th Annual Academy Awards - Oscar Statuette<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, who first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette reminding her of her Uncle Oscar. Columnist Qiang Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, "Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'" (Levy 2003). The trophy was officially dubbed the "Oscar" in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.oscar.com/oscarhistory/?pn=statuette|title=OSCAR.com - 80th Annual Academy Awards - Oscar Statuette|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\nAs of the [[80th Academy Awards]] ceremony held in 2008, a total of 2,701 Oscars have been awarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/awards/index.html|title= A Brief History of the Oscar|publisher= Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2008-08-04}}</ref> A total of 293 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards.\n\n===Ownership of Oscar statuettes===\nSince 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums (Levy 2003).{{Fact|date=February 2009}} \n\nThis rule is highly controversial, since while the Oscar is under the ownership of the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url        = http://www.forbes.com/2005/02/28/cx_lr_0228oscarsales.html\n   |title      = Psst!

When Todd's grandson attempted to sell Todd's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector, the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, the buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}\n\n==Nomination==\nSince 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to 2004, nomination results were announced publicly in early February.\n\n===Voters===\nThe [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,829 as of 2007.<ref> {{cite news | author=Sandy Cohen | title=Academy Sets Oscars Contingency Plan | url=http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001 | work=AOL News | date=2008-01-30 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>\n\nActors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition.

Invitation comes from the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.\n\nNew membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www. oscars. org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html|title = Academy Invites 115 to Become Members|publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 2007-09-04}}</ref>\n\n===Rules===\nToday, according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to qualify.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url        = http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/rules/rule02.html\n   |title      = Rule Two: Eligibility\n   |publisher  = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n   |accessdate = 2007-04-13\n    }}</ref> Rule 2 states that a film must be "feature-length", defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&nbsp;frame/s or 48&nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with native resolution not less than [[720p|1280x720]].\n\nThe members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture.

It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent [[fashion]] designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)\n\nThe Academy Awards is televised live across the United States (excluding [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]]), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters|title=International Broadcasters from Oscars.com|publisher = Oscars.com}}</ref> The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.<ref>[http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html Nielsen - Press Release: The Nielsen Company's 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards]</ref> Other awards ceremonies (such as the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]], [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]], and [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]) are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]] in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources. The usual extension of this claim is that only the [[Super Bowl]], [[Olympics]] Opening Ceremonies, and [[FIFA World Cup]] Final draw higher viewership.\n\nThe Awards show was first televised on [[NBC]] in 1953. [[NBC]] continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which [[NBC]] resumed the broadcasts. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] once again took over broadcast duties in 1976; it is under contract to do so through the year 2014.<ref>{{cite press release\n   |url        = http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.02.07.html\n   |title      = ABC and Academy Extend Oscar Telecast Agreement\n   |publisher  = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n   |date=        February 7, 2005\n   |accessdate = 2007-04-13\n    }}</ref>\n\nAfter more than sixty years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[Nielsen Ratings#"Sweeps"|sweeps]] period. (The ceremony was moved into early March during 2006, in deference to the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].) Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast.

The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budgeted, independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.94 million with a

276108584	{{Refimprove|date=November 2006}}\n\n'''International Atomic Time''' ('''[http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html TAI]''', from the [[French language|French]] name '''Temps Atomique International''') is a high-precision atomic [[coordinate time|coordinate]] [[time standard]] based on the notional passage of [[proper time]] on [[Earth]]'s [[geoid]].  It is the principal realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]], and the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface. {{As of|2009}}, TAI was exactly 34 seconds ahead of UTC: an initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 24 [[leap second]]s in UTC since 1972 (the last leap second was added on December 31, 2008).<ref name="tai-utc.dat">{{cite web |url=ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat |title=History of TAI−UTC |publisher=Time Service Dept., [[United States Naval Observatory|U.S. Naval Observatory]] |accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref><ref name="Bulletin C 36">{{cite web | last = Gambis | first = Daniel | title = Bulletin C 36 | publisher =  [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS EOP PC]], [[Paris Observatory|Observatoire de Paris]] | location = [[Paris]] | date = [[2008-07-04]] | url = http://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.36 | accessdate = 2009-01-04 }}</ref>\n\nTime coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used.  TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.\n\n==Operation==\n\nTAI as a [[frequency]] standard is a weighted average of the time kept by about 300 [[atomic clock]]s in over 50 national laboratories worldwide. The clocks are compared using satellites (see [http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/clock_comparisons.html BIPM clock comparisons]).  Many of these are [[caesium]] atomic clocks, which are the standard by which the [[SI]] [[second]] is defined.  Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone.\n\nThe participating institutions each broadcast, in real time (in the [[present]]), a frequency signal with [[time code]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC. The better laboratories' signals are mutually synchronised to within less than 10<sup>-7</sup> s, but there are outliers up to 10<sup>-5</sup> s out.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''TAI(NPL)'' (''UTC(NPL)'' for the UTC form), where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  Some laboratories also publish their own atomic time scale, denoted in the form ''TA(USNO)'' (''USNO'' identifies the [[United States Naval Observatory]]).\n\nThe clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.  This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the [[canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(x) and TAI-TA(x), for each participating institution x.\n\nErrors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).  See the article on TT for more information.\n\n==History==\n\nAtomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL).  The first formalised atomic time scale was the ''A.1'' scale defined by USNO in 1959.  A.1 was defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1958-01-01T00:00:00) at the [[UT2]] instant JD 2436204.5 (1958-01-01T00:00:00) as calculated at USNO.  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several [[centisecond]]s.  A.1 was extrapolated backwards to 1956.\n\nIn 1961, the [[Bureau International de l'Heure]] (BIH) (later superseded by the BIPM and the IERS) constructed an atomic time scale named ''AM'' based on three atomic clocks.  The clocks were compared by listening to radio [[time signal]]s based on them.  The BIH's time scale was synchronised with A.1's epoch, and extrapolated back to 1955 using time signals from the first caesium clock at NPL.  This time scale was soon renamed from AM to ''A3''.\n\nAlso in 1961, UTC began.  UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximates [[UT1]].  This was a [[compromise]] arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.\n\nIn 1967 the SI second was redefined in terms of the frequency supplied by a caesium atomic clock.\n\nMore clocks were added to the A3 time scale from 1967, and it was renamed to ''TA''.  Finally in 1971 it was renamed ''TAI''.\n\nIn the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the [[altitude]]s of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1977-01-01T00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10<sup>-12</sup>.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').\n\nThe instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and Terrestrial Time (TT).  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1977-01-01T00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide continuity with the older [[Ephemeris Time]].)  TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s.\n\nIn the 1990s, annual periodic variations in the rate of some clocks were traced to [[blackbody radiation]] that varies with the ambient [[temperature]].  It became clear that a correction for this was required.  Accordingly, in 1997 the BIPM declared that the definition of the SI second referred to a caesium atom at rest and at [[absolute zero]] temperature.  Temperature corrections were implemented in TAI from 1995 to 1998, speeding TAI up by about 10<sup>-14.3</sup>.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Time and frequency transfer]]\n* [[Clock synchronization]]\n* [[Network Time Protocol]] (used to disseminate TAI in the form of UTC)\n* [[Precision Time Protocol]], a related though separate technology\n* [[Magneto-optical trap]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bipm.fr/enus/5_Scientific/c_time/time_1.html ''Bureau International des Poids et Mesures: TAI'']\n* [http://www.npl.co.uk/time/ ''Time and Frequency Section - National Physical Laboratory, UK'']\n* [http://hpiers.obspm.fr IERS website]\n* [http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/general/faq.htm  ''NIST Time and Frequency FAQs'']\n* [http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/timescales.html History of time scales]\n* [http://physics.nist.gov/TechAct/Div847/div847.html ''NIST cesium fountain standard'']\n* [http://inms-ienm.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/research/optical_frequency_projects_e.html#femtosecond Optical frequency comb for metrology and timekeeping]\n* [http://jjy.nict.go.jp/index-e.html ''Japan Standard Time Project, NICT, Japan'']\n\n{{Time Topics}}\n{{Time measurement and standards}}\n\n[[Category:Time scales]]\n\n[[cs:Mezinárodní atomový čas]]\n[[de:Internationale Atomzeit]]\n[[es:Tiempo atómico]]\n[[eo:Tempo atoma internacia]]\n[[fr:Temps atomique international]]\n[[ko:국제원자시]]\n[[id:Waktu Atom Internasional]]\n[[it:Tempo atomico internazionale]]\n[[he:הזמן האטומי הבינלאומי]]\n[[ja:国際原子時]]\n[[pl:Międzynarodowy czas atomowy]]\n[[pt:Tempo Atômico Internacional]]\n[[ro:Timpul atomic internaţional]]\n[[ru:Международное атомное время]]\n[[sk:Medzinárodný atómový čas]]\n[[sl:Mednarodni atomski čas]]\n[[sv:Internationell atomtid]]\n[[vi:Thời gian Nguyên tử Quốc tế]]\n[[zh:原子时]]

Research on altruism was sparked in particular after the murder of [[Kitty Genovese]] in 1964,<ref> Vinciane Despret, ''Naissance d'une théorie éthologique - la danse du cratérope écaillé'', Les Empêcheurs de penser en rond, 1996, p.38 {{fr icon}}</ref> who was stabbed for over half an hour in front of passive witnesses who refrained from helping her.\n\n==Viewpoints==\n===Sociology===<!--Problem of love redirects here-->\n{{Original research|date=July 2008}}\n\nIf one performs an act beneficial to others with a view to gaining some personal benefit, then it is not an altruistically motivated act. There are several different perspectives on how "benefit" (or "interest") should be defined. A material gain (for example, money, a physical reward, etc.) is clearly a form of benefit, while others identify and include both material and immaterial gains (affection, respect, happiness, satisfaction etc.) as being philosophically identical benefits.  [[Knox]] (1999) ultimately argues that "Altruistic volunteers are either not truly altruistic or not rational."\n\nFor illustration of this, Knox (1999) describes circumstances which he terms as "the volunteers folly". In his example a lawyer volunteers his time on the weekends to help build low cost housing - professing that his motivation to do so is to help provide housing for the needy. However, Knox identifies that this is not the proper way for a lawyer to serve that particular interest. Since the lawyer's work as a lawyer generates far more money than his work on the building site is worth, Knox suggests that he should simply put in more work as a lawyer and donate the proceeds of that work. This would serve his professed purpose to a higher degree, since that money would afford the project several times more work than he himself could provide to the project directly.<ref name="knox">Knox, Trevor, ''The Volunteer's Folly and Socio-Economic Man: Some Thoughts On Altruism, Rationality, and Community'', Journal of Socio-Economics 28 (1999), 475-492</ref>\n\nSome may find this logic disagreeable or counterintuitive as an ideation of altruism, because it seems to require that martyrdom — or fatal sacrifice for a greater cause — be the only actualization of altruism.\n\n====Psychology====\n\nPsychological egoism can be accused of using [[circular logic]].  For instance, an egoist would not disagree with the following [[syllogism]]: "If a person has willingly performed an act, then he/she has manifested such intent in the form of that act.  Fulfillment of one's desires is the primary requisite of satisfaction.  Ergo, a person can only willingly perform acts that result in his/her personal enjoyment."  This logic is sometimes viewed as circular or presumptuous.  Specifically, egoism leans on the assumption that satisfaction is synonymous with self-satisfaction.  Such a precept automatically sidesteps counterpoint, however, and remains [[unfalsifiable]].  Thus, until [[empirical evidence]] favors one view or the other, egoism must acquiesce to [[uncertainty]]. \n\nHumans are not exclusively altruistic towards family members, previous co-operators or potential future allies, but can be altruistic towards people they don't know and will never meet. For example, some humans donate to international [[Charitable organization|charities]] and volunteer their time to help [[society]]'s less fortunate. It can however be argued that an individual would contribute to a charity to gain respect or stature within his/her own community.\n \nBeginning with an understanding that rational human beings benefit from living in a benign universe, logically it follows that particular human beings may gain substantial emotional satisfaction from acts which they perceive to make the world a better place.\n\n===Ethology===\n{{main|Altruism in animals|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}\nIn the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.<ref name=Bell2008>{{Citation\n | last = Bell | first =  Graham\n | year = 2008\n | title = Selection : the mechanism of evolution\n | pages = 367–368\n | isbn = 0198569726\n | publisher = Oxford University Press\n | location = Oxford\n}}</ref> Researchers on alleged altruist behaviours among animals have been ideologically opposed to the [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] concept of the "[[survival of the fittest]]", under the name of "survival of the nicest"&mdash;the latter being globally compatible, however, with [[darwinism|Darwin's]] [[theory of evolution]]. Insistence on such cooperative behaviours between animals was first exposed by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]''.\n\nRecent developments in [[game theory]] (see [[ultimatum game]]) have provided some explanations for apparent altruism, as have traditional evolutionary analyses. Among the proposed mechanisms are:\n\n* Behavioural manipulation (for example, by certain [[parasites]] that can alter the behavior of the host)\n* [[Bounded rationality]] (for example, [[Herbert Simon]])\n* [[Conscience]]\n* [[Kin selection]] including [[eusociality]] (see also "[[selfish gene]]")\n* [[Meme]]s (by influencing behaviour to favour their own spread, for example, [[religion]])\n* [[Reciprocal altruism]], mutual aid\n* Selective investment theory <ref>Brown, S.L. & Brown, R.M.

Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]] which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides''. These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body. Social behavior and altruism share many similarities to the interactions between the many parts (cells, genes) of an organism, but are distinguished by the ability of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an absolute requirement for its neighbors.\n\nJorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October, 2006,<ref>Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623-15628)</ref> they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed their interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.<ref name="brain">{{cite news\n|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052701056.html\n|title=If It Feels Good to Be Good, It Might Be Only Natural\n|publisher=Washington Post\n|date=May 2007}}</ref>\n\n\nA new study by [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in [[New Mexico]], US, is seen by some as breathing new life into the model of [[group selection]] for Altruism, known as "Survival of the nicest". Bowles conducted a genetic analysis of contemporary foraging groups, including [[Australian aboriginals]], native [[Siberian]] [[Inuit]] populations and indigenous tribal groups in Africa. It was found that [[hunter-gatherer]] bands of up to 30 individuals were considerably more closely related than was previously thought.  Under these conditions, thought to be similar to those of the middle and upper [[Paleolithic]], altruism towards other group-members would improve the overall fitness of the group. \n\nIf an individual defended the group but was killed, any genes that the individual shared with the overall group would still be passed on.  Early customs such as food sharing or [[monogamy]] could have levelled out the “cost” of altruistic behaviour, in the same way that income taxes redistribute income in society. He assembled genetic, climactic, archaeological, ethnographic and experimental data to examine the cost-benefit relationship of human cooperation in ancient populations.  In his model, members of a group bearing genes for altruistic behaviour pay a "tax" by limiting their reproductive opportunities to benefit from sharing food and information, thereby increasing the average fitness of the group as well as their inter-relatedness. Bands of altruistic humans would then act together to gain resources from other groups at this challenging time in history.<ref>Fisher, Richard (07 December 2006) "Why altruism paid off for our ancestors" (NewScientist.com news service) [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10750.html]</ref>.\n\nAltruist theories in evolutionary biology were contested by [[Amotz Zahavi]], the inventor of the signal theory and its correlative, the [[handicap principle]], based mainly on his observations of the [[Arabian Babbler]], a bird commonly known for its surprising (alleged) altruistic behaviours.\n\n===Religion===\n{{see also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}\nMost, if not all, of the world's [[religion]]s promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Sikhism]] ,etc, place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.\n\n====Christianity====\n\nAltruism was central to the teachings of [[Jesus]] found in the [[Gospel]] especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love," as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase "love seeks not its own interests." In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception'', Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. If love, which confirms others in their freedom, shuns propagandas and masks, assurance of its presence is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love become validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the doing.\n\nThough it might seem obvious that altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus, one important and influential strand of Christianity would qualify this. [[St Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', I:II Quaestion 26, Article 4 states that we should love ourselves more than our neighbour. His interpretation of the Pauline phrase is that we should seek the common good more than the private good but this is because the common good is a more desirable good for the individual. 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' from [[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22 is interpreted by St Thomas as meaning that love for ourself is the exemplar of love for others. He does think though, that we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbour, taken as an entirety, more than our bodily life, since the ultimate purpose of love of our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude, a more desirable thing than bodily well being. Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, now part of mainstream Catholicism, in coining the word Altruism, as stated above.\n\n[[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love.  And altruistic action is not always loving action.  Oord defines altruism as acting for the good of the other, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the demands of the other undermine overall well-being.\n\n====Sikhism====\nAltruism is essential to the Sikh religion. In the late 1600s, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Moghul]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths, when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to  both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield.\n"What were you doing, and why?" asked the Guru. "I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya. \nThe Guru responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru." \n\nIt was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same. <ref>{{Citation\n | year = 1997\n | title = The great gurus of the Sikhs, pg, 253\n | isbn = 8174884793\n | publisher = Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd.\n | location = New Delhi\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{MultiCol}} \n* [[Altruism (ethics)]]\n* [[Altruism in animals]]\n* [[Altruria]]\n* [[Charity (practice)]]\n* [[Charitable organization]]\n* [[Egoism]]\n* [[Empathy-altruism]]\n* [[Empathy]] \n{{ColBreak}}\n* [[Family economics]]\n* [[Gene-centered view of evolution]]\n* [[Justice (economics)]]\n* [[Kin selection]]\n* [[Misanthropy]]\n* [[mutual aid]]\n* [[Philanthropy]]\n{{ColBreak}} \n* [[Prosocial behavior]]\n* [[Random acts of kindness]]\n* [[Reciprocal altruism]]\n* [[Selfishness]]\n* [[Social psychology]]\n* [[Solidarity (sociology)]]\n* [[Tit for tat]]\n{{EndMultiCol}}\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n<div class="references-small" style="-moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2;">\n*[[Thomas Jay Oord|Oord, Thomas Jay]] (2007).

Reality exists as an objective absolute—facts are facts, independent of man’s feelings, wishes, hopes or fears. 2. Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided by man’s senses) is man's only means of perceiving reality, his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival. 3. Man—every man—is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life. 4. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a system where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutual benefit.

The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which industrialists and other creative individuals go on [[strike action|strike]] and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent [[Free market|free economy]]. The hero, [[John Galt (Atlas Shrugged)|John Galt]], describes the strike as "stopping the motor of the world" by withdrawing the people that Rand saw as contributing the most to the nation's productivity and creativity.

Addressing the United States Military Academy at West Point on March 6, 1974, she said that, "[f]or some two hundred years, under the influence of Immanuel Kant, the dominant trend of philosophy has been directed to a single goal: the destruction of man's mind, of his confidence in the power of reason," and continued:\n{{bquote|Today's mawkish concern with and compassion for the feeble, the flawed, the suffering, the guilty, is a cover for the profoundly Kantian hatred of the innocent, the strong, the able, the successful, the virtuous, the confident, the happy.

Morgan Library) in New York City, the city she most loved and admired. From 1965 to her death in 1982, she resided at 120 East 34th Street. In New York, she formed a group (jokingly designated "[[The Ayn Rand Collective|The Collective]]") which included future [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and [[Leonard Peikoff]], all of whom had been profoundly influenced by ''The Fountainhead.'' Rand launched the [[Objectivist philosophy|Objectivist]] movement with this group to promote her philosophy.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}\n\nThe group originally started out as an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy; later the Collective would proceed to play a larger, more formal role, reading ''Atlas Shrugged'' as the manuscript pages were written and promoting Rand's philosophy through the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), established by him for that purpose. Many Collective members gave lectures at the NBI and in cities across the United States, while others wrote articles for her publications, ''[[The Objectivist Newsletter]]'' and ''[[The Objectivist]].'' Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her non-fiction works, and by giving talks at several prominent universities, including Yale, Columbia, and the University of Michigan. "''[[The Objectivist Newsletter]],'' later expanded and renamed simply ''The Objectivist,'' contained essays by Rand, Branden, and other associates ... that analyzed current political events and applied the principles of Objectivism to everyday life."<ref name="JVL"/> Rand later published some of these in book form.\n\nAfter several years, Rand's close relationship with the much younger Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/bio/biofaq.html#Q4.4 | title="Ayn Rand Biographical FAQ: Did Rand have an affair with Nathaniel Branden?" | accessdate=2008-04-28}}</ref> It lasted until Branden (having separated from Barbara) entered into an affair with the young actress [[Patrecia Scott]], whom he later married.

She wrote that her advocacy of capitalism in politics and egoism in ethics was only a consequence of her advocacy of reason in epistemology. She defined "reason" as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses."\n\nTo defend and explain her position on reason, she developed a theory of sense-perception that distinguishes between the form and object of perception, holding that the form in which an organism perceives is determined by its physiological means of perception but that in whatever form it perceives, ''what'' it perceives—the object of its perception—is reality. She rejected the Kantian dichotomy between "things as we perceive them" and "things as they are in themselves." Perception, she held, is the unchallengeable given; perception, being physiologically determined, cannot make mistakes or err. Apparent errors, such as in "optical illusions," she regarded as errors in the conceptual identification of what is seen, not in the seeing itself. Perception is, she argued, automatic, infallible, and provides the base for the non-automatic, fallible processes of conceptual interpretation and inference that is the sphere of reason.\n\nIn her 1979 work, ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'', Rand presented her novel theory of concepts—in effect, her solution to the age-old "problem of universals." In essence, her theory holds that concepts (abstract ideas) are classifications of existents that possess ''commensurable'' characteristics. Things that are similar, she held, have "the same characteristic but in different measure or degree." Seeing many links between concepts and mathematics, her theory of concepts uses such mathematical terms as "unit," "measurement," and "common denominator." Her definition of "concept" is: "A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted."\n\nIn other areas of epistemology, she advanced a theory that concepts, and knowledge generally, is both contextual and hierarchical. She rejected the "analytic-synthetic" dichotomy, holding that the meaning of a concept includes ''all'' the characteristics of its referents, including those yet to be discovered. Her overall theory of the cognitive function of concepts was that they expand man's range of awareness by condensing the number of units one needs to hold in mind in one frame of awareness ("unit-economy").\n\nA strong advocate of Aristotelian logic, she titled the three parts of ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' with the names of the three axioms of Aristotelian logic: "A is A," "Non-Contradiction," and "Either/Or." In regard to inductive logic, she held that her theory of concepts would provide the basis for a new approach to validating inductive generalization, and [[Leonard Peikoff]] has attempted this development.\n\n===Ethics===\n{{Refimprove|section|date=February 2009}}\nRand's ethical egoism is her most well-known position. She advocated "rational selfishness." In ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' she gave an original validation of her moral code, claiming to have bridged the infamous gap between [[Is-ought problem|"Is" and "Ought"]]—or between facts and values. She begins by asking "What are values? Why does man need them?" She argues that the concept of "value" depends upon the concept of an "alternative" in the face of which one must act. "Where no alternatives exist, no goals and no values are possible."<ref name="obj-ethics">"The Objectivist Ethics," in ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]''.</ref>  The next point in her derivation is to argue that "there is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action....It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death....It is only the concept of 'Life' that makes the concept of 'Value' possible."<ref name="obj-ethics"/>\n\nAll living organisms, she held, act to gain values—i.e., the items their survival requires. An organism's own life is its ultimate value. But man enters the sphere of ''moral'' values because man has free will: one does not automatically hold his own life as his ultimate value. Whether he acts to promote and fulfill his own life or not is up to him, not hard-wired into his physiology. "Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history."<ref>''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', p. 931.</ref> The purpose of a moral code, Rand held, is to provide a ''standard of value'' and a code of virtues by reference to which man can achieve the values his survival requires and which enhance his life. Her standard of value is: "Man's life qua rational being," and rationality is the primary virtue of this code. The derivative virtues of her Objectivist morality are: independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, and pride—each of which she explains in some detail in "The Objectivist Ethics."\n\nIntegrating with this is her view that the primary locus of man's free will is in the choice: to think or not to think. "Thinking is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one's consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections it might happen to make."<ref>''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'', p. 21.</ref>\n\nShe concludes that "for you, who are a human being, the question 'to be or not to be' is the question 'to think or not to think.'"<ref>''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', p. 939.</ref>\n\n==Political and social views==\nRand held that the only moral social system is ''laissez-faire'' capitalism. Her political views were strongly [[individualism|individualist]] and hence [[anti-statist]] and [[anti-Communist]]. She exalted what she saw as the heroic [[American values]] of [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]]. As a champion of rationality, Rand also had a strong opposition to [[mysticism]] and religion, which she believed helped foster a crippling culture acting against individual human happiness and success. Rand detested many prominent [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[American conservatism|conservative]] politicians of her time, including prominent anti-Communists, such as [[Harry S.

Rand denied endorsing any kind of power-difference between men and women, stating that man's "metaphysical dominance" in sexual relations refers to the man's role as the prime mover in sex and the necessity of male arousal for sex to occur.<ref name="Ayn Rand Answers">{{cite book |author=Rand, Ayn; Mayhew, Robert J. |title=Ayn Rand answers: the best of her Q & A |publisher=New American Library |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-451-21665-2}}{{pn}}</ref> According to Rand, "For a woman ''qua'' woman, the essence of femininity is hero-worship—the desire to look up to man."<ref name = "iijwxo">{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=An Answer to Readers (about a Woman President) |journal=The Objectivist |year=1968 |volume=7 |issue=12}}{{pn}}</ref> Rand believed that sex in its highest form is a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values, a means of giving concrete, physical expression to values that could otherwise only be experienced in the abstract.\n\nIn a [[McCall's]] magazine interview, Rand stated that while women are competent to be [[President of the United States]], as a matter of psychology, no rational woman would enjoy being in that position (as a woman in charge of men); she later explained that it would be psychologically damaging to the woman.<ref name = "iijwxo"/> She strongly opposed the modern [[feminist]] movement, despite supporting women needing careers and being the intellectual equals of men.<ref name="new left">{{cite book |author=Rand, Ayn |title=The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution |publisher=Plume |location=New York |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-452-01125-6}}{{pn}}</ref> Feminist author [[Susan Brownmiller]] called Rand "a traitor to her own sex," while others, including [[Camille Paglia]] and the contributors to 1999's ''Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand,'' have noted Rand's "fiercely independent—and unapologetically sexual" heroines who are unbound by "tradition's chains ...

Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented the socioeconomic conditions in the Soviet Union and portrayed life in the USSR as being much better and happier than it actually was.

Ronald E. Merrill writes: "Objectivism did not grow out of the academic mainstream, even as a revolt against it; if it had, it might have been better received." "Above all, academia finds Objectivism totally indigestible because of the philosophy's inherent and aggressive anti-relativism." <ref name=m154/> Rand scholars such as Sciabarra, Tara Smith, and Allan Gotthelf have made attempts to introduce her into formal academia, while others, such as Ronald E. Merrill, have claimed that academic rejection of Rand stems from fear of it as a "living" philosophy as opposed to an academic "game." Merrill writes in ''The Ideas of Ayn Rand'': "Will the day ever come when Objectivism gets a place in the philosophy curriculum?" and answers, "That will be the day when professors no longer fear Objectivism-because it will be dead."<ref name=m154>{{Cite book|last=Merrill |first=Ronald |title=The Ideas of Ayn Rand |publication=Full Court |year=1998 |page=154}}</ref>\n\n===Philosophical criticism===\n{{main|Criticism of Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}\nOnline ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' columnist Sara Dabney Tisdale says academic philosophers have generally dismissed ''Atlas Shrugged'' as "sophomoric, preachy, and unoriginal."<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Tisdale\n  | first = Sara Dabney\n  | author-link = \n  | last2 = \n  | first2 = \n  | author2-link = \n  | title = A Celebration of Self\n  | newspaper = U.S. News & World Report\n  | page = 72\n  | year = 2007\n  | date = August 13\n  | url =http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070805/13atlas.htm }}</ref>  In addition, Greg Nyquist has written that Rand's philosophy fundamentally misunderstands the very core of human nature.<ref>{{cite book |author=Nyquist, Greg S. |title=Ayn Rand Contra Human Nature  |publisher=AuthorHouse |location=Bloomington, IN |year=2001 |page=407 |isbn=0595196330}}</ref>\n\nOn his blog, Kant scholar William Vallicella has been scathing in describing what he calls her lack of [[Rigour#Intellectual_rigour|rigour]] and limited understanding of philosophical subject-matter.<ref>{{cite web|authorlink=William Vallicella |first=William |last=Vallicella |url=http://maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com/2004/06/rands-misunderstanding-of-kant.html |work=Maverick Philosopher |title=Rand's Misunderstanding of Kant |date=June 9, 2004 |accessdate=February 13, 2009}}{{cite web|date=May 28, 2004 |title=Is Ayn Rand a Good Philosopher? |work=Maverick Philosopher |first=William |last=Vallicella |url=http://maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com/2004/05/is-ayn-rand-good-philosopher.html |accessdate=February 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOne significant exception to the general lack of attention paid to Rand in academic philosophy is the essay "On the Randian Argument" by [[Harvard University]] philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], which appears in his collection, ''[[Socratic Puzzles]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nozick |first=Robert |title=Socratic Puzzles |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1997 |isbn=0-674-81654-4 |chapter=On the Randian Argument}}{{pn}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Celebrating the life of a friend of liberty |journal=University Wire |date=January 31, 2002 |first=James |last=Eaves-Johnson }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=What's not to like about Libertarianism? |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |authorlink=Brian Doherty (journalist) |first=Brian |last=Doherty |date=March 25, 2007}}</ref> Nozick is sympathetic to Rand's political conclusions, but does not think her arguments justify them. In particular, his essay criticizes her foundational argument in ethics—laid out most explicitly in her book ''The Virtue of Selfishness''—which claims that one's own life is, for each individual, the ultimate value because it makes all other values possible. Nozick says that to make this argument sound one needs to explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and thus having no values. Therefore, he argues, her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is essentially an instance of [[begging the question]]. Nozick also argues that Rand's solution to [[David Hume]]'s famous [[is-ought problem]] is unsatisfactory.{{context needed}} [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]] responds to this criticism in her book ''Viable Values.''{{page number}} Philosophers Douglas Rasmussen and Douglas Den Uyl have also responded to Nozick's article, arguing that there are basic misstatements of Rand's case on Nozick's part.<ref>"Den Uyl and Rasmussen, "Nozick on the Randian Argument," ''The Personalist'', Spring, 1978, reprinted in ''Reading Nozick: Essays on Anarchy, State and Utopia'', J.

It was unrelentingly scathing. Chambers called the book "sophomoric"; and "remarkably silly," and said it "can be called a novel only by devaluing the term." He described the tone of the book as "shrillness without reprieve." Chambers accused Rand of supporting the same godless system as the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Soviets]], claiming "From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To the gas chambers—go!'"<ref>{{Citation | surname=Chambers | given=Whittaker | authorlink=Whittaker Chambers | title=Big Sister is Watching You | journal=National Review | year=1957 | pages=594–596 | url=http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles2/ChambersAynRand.shtml}}</ref> Five decades later, ''Capitalism Magazine'' published a reply, arguing that Chambers had not actually read the book, as he misspelled the names of two major characters and used no quotations from the novel in his critique.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?id=4081|title=A Half-Century-Old Attack on Ayn Rand Reminds Us of the Dark Side of Conservatism|last=Tracinski|first=Robert|date=2005-01-06|publisher=[http://www.capmag.com Capitalism Magazine]|accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref>\n\nAnother critic, Mimi Gladstein (author of ''The New Ayn Rand Companion''), called Rand's characters flat and uninteresting, and her heroes implausibly wealthy, intelligent, physically attractive and free of doubt while arrayed against antagonists who are weak, pathetic, full of uncertainty, and lacking in imagination and talent.<ref>{{cite book |title=Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand |first=Mimi R. |last=Gladstein |coauthor=Chris Matthew Sciabarra |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-271-01831-3 |page=140}}</ref>\n\nRand stated in a 1963 essay, titled "The Goal of My Writing", that her fiction was intentionally different in that its goal was to project a vision of an ideal man: not man as he is, but man as he might be and ought to be.

They were nearly censored by the [[Italy|Italian]] government under [[Benito Mussolini]], but they were permitted because the novel upon which they were based was anti-Soviet. The films were successful, and the public easily realized that they were as much against Fascism as Communism.
